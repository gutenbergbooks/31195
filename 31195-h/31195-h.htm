<p>&ldquo;At last we have a treatise upon our caricaturists and comic draughtsmen
worthy of the great subject.... An entertaining history of caricature,
and consequently of the events, political and social, of the century;
in fact, a thoroughly readable and instructive book.... And what a
number of political occurrences, scandals public and private, movements
political and secular, are passed in review! All these events Mr. Everitt
describes at length with great clearness and vivacity, giving us a view of
them, so to speak, from the inside.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a handsome and important volume of 400 pages; the letterpress
being a brightly written commentary, abounding with illustrative gossip,
on the caricature of the century and the merits of its graphic humourists....
It includes a great deal of the more stirring social and political
history of the time. The illustrations so plentifully strewn through Mr.
Everitt&rsquo;s volume give it a peculiar interest.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>St. James&rsquo;s Gazette.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The work, which contains a large amount of information and some
valuable lists of publications, is illustrated with about seventy wood engravings.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Literary
World.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;A real contribution to the history of the social life of the century. The
book is very fully and well illustrated, forming in fact quite a gallery of
nineteenth century caricature.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Truth.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The plates with which it is illustrated are remarkably well produced,
and are useful in themselves, and are neatly and <span class="correction" title="amended from cleary">clearly</span> printed, so that they
give a capital idea of the originals from which they are prepared.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Saturday

<h3>PREFACE.</h3>
<hr class="short" />

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> only works which, so far as I know, profess to deal
with English caricaturists and comic artists of the nineteenth
century are two in number. The first is a work by the late
Robert William Buss, embodying the substance of certain
lectures delivered by the accomplished author many years
ago. Mr. Buss&rsquo;s book, which was published for private circulation
only, deals more especially with the work of James
Gillray, his predecessors and contemporaries, treating only
briefly and incidentally of a few of his successors of our own
day. The second is a work by Mr. James Parton, an
American author, whose book (published by Harper Brothers,
of New York) treats of &ldquo;Caricature, and other Comic Art in
all Times and many Lands.&rdquo; It is obviously no part of my
duty (even if I felt disposed to do so) to criticise the work
of a brother scribe, and that scribe an American gentleman.
Covering an area so boundless in extent, it is scarcely surprising
that Mr. Parton should devote only thirty of his
pages to the consideration of English caricaturists and
graphic humourists of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, it would seem to me that, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagevi"></a>vi</span>
placing the present work before the public, an apology will
scarcely be considered necessary.</p>

<p>Depending oftentimes for effect upon overdrawing, nearly
always upon a graphic power entirely out of the range of
ordinary art, the work of the caricaturist is not to be
measured by the ordinary standard of artistic excellence, but
rather by the light which it throws upon popular opinion or
popular prejudice, in relation to the events, the remembrance
of which it perpetuates and chronicles. While, however, a
latitude is allowed to the caricaturist which would be inconsistent
with the principles by which the practice of art
is ordinarily governed, it may at the same time be safely
laid down that it is essential to the success of the comic
designer as well as the caricaturist, that both should be
<i>artists</i> of ability, though not necessarily men of absolute
genius.</p>

<p>It may be contended that Gillray, Rowlandson, Bunbury,
and others, although commencing work before, are really
quite as much nineteenth century graphic satirists as their
successors. This I admit; but inasmuch as their work has
been already described by other writers, and the present
book concerns itself especially with those whose labours
commenced after 1800, I have endeavoured to connect them
with those of their predecessors and contemporaries, without
unnecessarily entering into detail with which the reader is
supposed to be already more or less familiar.</p>

<p>I am in hopes that the character in which I am enabled to
present George Cruikshank as the leading caricaturist of the
century; the account I have given of his hitherto almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagevii"></a>vii</span>
unknown work of this character; together with the view I
have taken of the causes which led to his sudden and unexampled
declension in the very midst of an artistic success
almost unprecedented, may prove both new and interesting
to some of my readers.</p>

<p>I have to acknowledge the assistance I have derived from
the 1864 and 1867 MS. diaries of the late Shirley Brooks,
kindly placed at my service by Cecil Brooks, Esq., his son;
my thanks are likewise due to Mr. William Tegg for some
valuable information kindly rendered.</p>

<h3>PREFACE TO THE PRESENT EDITION.</h3>
<hr class="short" />

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Having</span> been called on to write a Preface to a popular
edition of this book, I seize the opportunity which is now
afforded me of correcting an error which occurred in the
original edition. By some unaccountable accident the printer
omitted my sub-title; and it was not unnatural that some
of my reviewers should inquire <i>why</i>, in a work dealing with
English Caricaturists of the Nineteenth Century, no mention
should be made of the graphic humourists who succeeded
John Leech. This question is answered by the restoration of
the original title, from which it will be seen that the work
is simply &ldquo;a <i>contribution</i> to the history of caricature from the
time of the first Napoleon <i>down</i> to the death of John Leech,
in 1864.&rdquo;  To take in the later humourists, would be to
carry the work beyond the limits which I had originally
assigned to it.</p>

<p>One word more, and I have done. My intention in writing
this book was to show how the caricaturist &ldquo;illustrated&rdquo; his
time,&mdash;in other words, how he &ldquo;interpreted&rdquo; the social and
political events of his day, according to his own bias, or the
views he was retained to serve. While exhibiting him in the
light of an <i>historian</i>&mdash;which he most undoubtedly is&mdash;I had
no idea (as some of my too favourable critics seem to have
imagined) of writing a history of caricature itself. For this
task, indeed, I am not qualified, nor does it in the slightest
degree enlist my sympathy.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<h5><i>OF THE ENGLISH CARICATURE AND ITS DECAY.</i></h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">If</span> you turn to the word &ldquo;<i>caricatura</i>&rdquo; in your Italian dictionary, it is
<span class="sn">Definition of Caricature</span>
just possible that you will be gratified by learning that it means
&ldquo;caricature&rdquo;; but if you refer to the same word in old Dr.
Johnson, he will tell you, with the plain, practical common-sense
which distinguished him, that it signifies &ldquo;an exaggerated resemblance
in drawings,&rdquo; and this expresses exactly what it <i>does</i> mean. Any
distinguishing feature or peculiarity, whether in face, figure, or dress,
is <i>exaggerated</i>, and yet the likeness is preserved. A straight nose is
presented unnaturally straight, a short nose unnaturally depressed;
a prominent forehead is drawn unusually bulbous; a protuberant
jaw unnaturally underhung; a fat man is depicted preternaturally fat,
and a thin one correspondingly lean. This at least was the idea of
<i>caricature</i> during the last century. Old Francis Grose, who, in 1791,
wrote certain &ldquo;Rules for Drawing Caricaturas,&rdquo; gives us the following
explanation of their origin:&mdash;&ldquo;The sculptors of ancient Greece,&rdquo; he
tells us, &ldquo;seem to have diligently observed the form and proportions
constituting the European ideas of beauty, and upon them to have
formed their statues. These measures are to be met with in many
drawing books; a slight deviation from them by the predominancy
of any feature constitutes what is called character, and serves to
discriminate the owner thereof and to fix the idea of identity. This
deviation or peculiarity aggravated, forms caricatura.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>2</span></p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the strict definition of the word given by
Francis Grose and Dr. Johnson is no longer applicable; the word
caricature includes, and has for a very long time been understood to
include, within its meaning any pictorial or graphic satire, political
or otherwise, and whether the drawing be exaggerated or not: it is
in this sense that Mr. Wright makes use of it in his &ldquo;Caricature
History of the Georges,&rdquo; and it is in this sense that we shall use it
for the purposes of this present book.</p>

<p>Since the commencement of the present century, and more
<span class="sn">Change in the Spirit of English Caricature.</span>
especially during the last fifty years, a change has come over the
spirit of English caricature. The fact is due to a variety of causes,
amongst which must be reckoned the revolution in dress and
manners; the extinction of the three-bottle men and topers; the
change of thought, manners, and habits consequent on the introduction
of steam, railways, and the electric telegraph. The casual
observer meeting, as he sometimes will, with a portfolio of etchings
representing the men with red and bloated features, elephantine
limbs, and huge paunches, who figure in the caricatures of the last
and the early part of the present century, may well be excused if he
doubt whether such figures of fun ever had an actual existence. Our
answer is that they not only existed, but were very far from
uncommon. Our great-grandfathers of 1800 were jolly good fellows;
washing down their beef-steaks with copious draughts of &ldquo;York or
Burton ale,&rdquo; or the porter for which Trenton, of Whitechapel,
appears to have been famed,<a name="FnAnchor_1" href="#Footnote_1"><span class="sp">1</span></a> fortifying themselves afterwards with
deeper draughts of generous wines&mdash;rich port, Madeira, claret,
dashed with hermitage&mdash;they set up before they were old men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>3</span>
paunches and diseases which rendered them a sight for gods and
men. Reader, be assured that the fat men who figure in the graphic
satires of the early part of the century were certainly <i>not</i> caricatured.</p>

<p>In connection with the subject of graphic satire, the names of the
<span class="sn">The three great Caricaturists of the Last Century.</span>
three great caricaturists of the last century&mdash;Gillray, Rowlandson,
and Bunbury&mdash;are indispensable. The last, a gentleman of family,
fortune, and position, and equerry to the Duke of York, was, in
truth, rather an amateur than an artist. Rowlandson was an able
draughtsman, and something more; but his style and his tastes are
essentially coarse and sensual, and his women are the overblown
beauties of the Drury Lane and Covent Garden of his day. George
Moutard Woodward, whose productions he sometimes honoured by
etching, and whose distinguishing characteristics are carelessness
and often bad drawing, follows him at a respectful distance. The
genius of James Gillray has won him the title of the &ldquo;Prince of
Caricaturists,&rdquo; a title he well earned and thoroughly deserved. The
only one of the nineteenth century caricaturists who touches him
occasionally in <i>caricature</i>, but distances him in everything else, is
our George Cruikshank.</p>

<p>Commencing work when George the Third was still a young man,
Gillray and Rowlandson necessarily infused into it some of the coarseness
and vulgarity of their century. With Gillray, indeed, this coarseness
and vulgarity may be said to be rather the exception than the
rule, whereas the exact contrary holds good of his able and too often
careless contemporary. As might have been expected, every one
who excites their ridicule or contempt is treated and (in their letterpress
descriptions) spoken of in the broadest manner. Bonaparte
is mentioned by both artists (in allusion to his supposed sanguinary
propensities) as &ldquo;Boney, the carcase butcher;&rdquo; Josephine is represented
by Gillray as a coarse fat woman, with the sensual habits of
a Drury Lane strumpet; Talleyrand, by right of his club foot and
limping gait, is invariably dubbed &ldquo;Hopping Talley.&rdquo; The influence
of both artists is felt by those who immediately succeeded them.
The coarseness, for instance, of Robert Cruikshank, when he displays
any at all, which is seldom, is directly traceable to the influence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>4</span>
of Rowlandson, whom (until he followed the example of his greater
brother) he at first copied.</p>

<p>Gillray wrought much the same influence upon George Cruikshank.
<span class="sn">Influence of Gillray on Cruikshank.</span>
I have seen it gravely asserted by some of those who have written
upon him,<a name="FnAnchor_2" href="#Footnote_2"><span class="sp">2</span></a> that this great artist never executed a drawing which
could call a blush into the cheek of modesty. But those who have
written upon George Cruikshank&mdash;and their name is legion&mdash;instead
of beginning at the beginning, and thus tracing the gradual and
almost insensible formation of his style, appear to me to have
plunged as it were into <i>medias res</i>, and commenced at the point
when he dropped caricature and became an illustrator of books.
Book illustration was scarcely an art until George Cruikshank made
it so; and the most interesting period of his artistic career appears
to us to be the one in which he pursued the path indicated by James
Gillray, until his career of caricaturist merged into his later employment
of a designer and etcher of book illustration, by which no
doubt he achieved his reputation. In answer to those who tell us
that he never produced a drawing which could call a blush into the
cheek of modesty, and never raised a laugh at the expense of
decency, we will only say that we can produce at least a score of
instances to the contrary. To go no further than &ldquo;The Scourge,&rdquo;
we will refer them to three: his <i>Dinner of the Four-in-Hand Club at
Salthill</i>, in vol. i.; his <i>Return to Office</i> (1st July, 1811), in vol. ii.;
and his <i>Coronation of the Empress of the Nares</i> (1st September, 1812),
in vol. iv.</p>

<p>As the century passed out of its infancy and attained the maturer
<span class="sn">Revolution effected by H. B.</span>
age of thirty years, a gradual and almost imperceptible change came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>5</span>
over the spirit of English graphic satire. The coarseness and suggestiveness
of the old caricaturists gradually disappeared, until at
length, in 1830, an artist arose who was destined to work a complete
revolution in the style and manner of English caricature. This
artist was John Doyle,&mdash;the celebrated H. B. He it was that
discovered that pictures might be made mildly diverting without
actual coarseness or exaggeration; and when this fact was accepted,
the art of caricaturing underwent a complete transition, and assumed
a new form. The &ldquo;Sketches&rdquo; of H. B. owe their chief attraction to
the excellence of their designer as a portrait painter; his successors,
with less power in this direction but with better general artistic
abilities, rapidly improved upon his idea, and thus was founded the
modern school of graphic satirists represented by Richard Doyle,
John Leech, and John Tenniel. So completely was the style of
comic art changed under the auspices of these clever men, that the
very name of &ldquo;caricature&rdquo; disappeared, and the modern word
&ldquo;cartoon&rdquo; assumed its place. With the exception indeed of Carlo
Pellegrini (the &ldquo;Ape&rdquo; of <i>Vanity Fair</i>), and his successors, we have
now no caricaturist in the old and true acceptation of the term, and
original and clever as their productions are, their compositions are
timid compared with those of Bunbury, Gillray, Rowlandson, and
their successors, being limited to a weekly &ldquo;exaggerated&rdquo; portrait,
instead of composed of many figures.</p>

<p>But caricature was destined to receive its final blow at the
hands of that useful craftsman the wood-engraver. The application
of wood-engraving to all kinds of illustration, whether graphic or
comic, and the mode in which time, labour, and expense are
economised, by the large wood blocks being cut up into squares,
and each square entrusted to the hands of a separate workman,
has virtually superseded the old and far more effective process
of etching. Economy is now the order of the day in matters of
graphic satire as in everything else; people are no longer found
willing to pay a shilling for a caricature when they may obtain
one for a penny. Hence it has come to pass, that whilst comic
artists abound, the prevailing spirit of economy has reduced their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>6</span>
productions to a dead level, and the work of an artist of inferior
power and invention, may successfully compete for public favour
with the work of a man of talent and genius like John Tenniel,
a result surely to be deplored, seeing there never was a time which
offered better opportunities for the pencil of a great and original
caricaturist than the present.<a name="FnAnchor_3" href="#Footnote_3"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>It is a common practice, and I may add mistake, with writers
<span class="sn">Mistake of those who compare modern Caricaturists with Hogarth.</span>
on comic artists or caricaturists of our day, to compare them with
Hogarth. Both Hogarth and the men of our day are graphic
satirists, but there is so broad a distinction between the satire of
each, and the circumstances of the times in which they respectively
laboured, that comparison is impossible. Those who know anything
of this great and original genius, must know that he entertained
the greatest horror of being mistaken for a <i>caricaturist</i> pure
and simple; and although he executed caricatures for special
purposes, they may literally be counted on the fingers. &ldquo;His
pictures,&rdquo; says Hazlitt, &ldquo;are not imitations of still life, or mere
transcripts of incidental scenes and customs; but powerful <i>moral</i>
satires, exposing vice and folly in their most ludicrous points of
view, and with a profound insight into the weak sides of character
and manners, in all their tendencies, combinations, and contrasts.
There is not a single picture of his containing a representation
of mere pictorial or domestic scenery.&rdquo; His object is not so much
&ldquo;to hold the mirror up to nature,&rdquo; as &ldquo;to show vice her own
feature, scorn her own image.&rdquo; &ldquo;Folly is there seen at the height&mdash;the
moon is at the full&mdash;it is the very error of the time. There
is a perpetual error of eccentricities, a tilt and tournament of
absurdities, pampered with all sorts of affectation, airy, extravagant,
and ostentatious! Yet <i>he is as little a caricaturist</i> as he is a
painter of still life. Criticism has not done him justice, though
public opinion has.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_4" href="#Footnote_4"><span class="sp">4</span></a> &ldquo;A set of severer satires,&rdquo; says Charles Lamb,
&ldquo;(for they are not so much comedies, which they have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>7</span>
likened to, as they are strong and masculine satires), less mingled
with anything of mere fun, were never written upon paper or
graven upon copper. They resemble Juvenal, or the satiric
touches in Timon of Athens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hogarth was a stern moralist and satirist, but his satires have
<span class="sn">Character of Hogarth&rsquo;s Satires.</span>
nothing in common with the satires of the nineteenth century; such
men as the infamous Charteris and the quack Misaubin figure in his
compositions, and their portraits are true to the life. Although his
satire is relieved with flashes of humour, the reality and gravity of
the satire remain undisturbed. The <i>March to Finchley</i> is one of the
severest satires on the times; it shows us the utter depravity of the
morals and manners of the day, the want of discipline of the king&rsquo;s
officers and soldiers, which led to the routs of Preston and Falkirk,
the headlong flight of Hawley and his licentious and cowardly
dragoons. Some modern writers know so little of him that they
have not only described his portrait of Wilkes as a <i>caricature</i>, but
have cited the inscription on his veritable contemporary <i>caricature</i>
of Churchill in proof of the assertion. Now what says this inscription?
&ldquo;The Bruiser (Churchill, once the Reverend), in the character
of a Russian Hercules, regaling himself after having killed the
monster <i>Caricatura, that so severely galled his virtuous friend</i>, the
heaven-born Wilkes.&rdquo; Hogarth&rsquo;s use of the word <i>caricatura</i> conveys
a meaning which is not patent at first sight; Wilkes&rsquo;s leer was the
leer of a satyr, &ldquo;his face,&rdquo; says Macaulay, &ldquo;was so hideous that the
caricaturists were forced in their own despite to flatter him.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_5" href="#Footnote_5"><span class="sp">5</span></a> The
real sting lies in the <i>accuracy</i> of Hogarth&rsquo;s portrait (a fact which
Wilkes himself admitted), and it is in this sarcastic sense that
Hogarth makes use of the word &ldquo;caricatura.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Turning from Hogarth to a modern artist, in spite of his faults of
<span class="sn">Gustave Doré.</span>
most marvellous genius and inventive faculty, I frequently find
critics of approved knowledge and sagacity describing the late
Gustave Doré as a caricaturist. It may seem strange at first sight to
introduce the name of Doré into a work dealing exclusively with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>8</span>
English caricature art, and I do so, not by reason of the fact that
his works are as familiar to us in England as in France, not because
he has pictorially interpreted some of the finest thoughts in English
literature, but because I find his name so constantly mentioned in
comparison with English caricaturists and comic artists, and more
especially with our George Cruikshank. Now Gustave Doré is, if
possible, still less a caricaturist than our English Hogarth. I have
seen the ghastly illustrations to the licentious &ldquo;Contes <span class="correction" title="changed from Diolatiques">Drolatiques</span>&rdquo;
of Balzac cited in proof of his claims to be considered a caricaturist.
I will not deny that Doré did try his hand once upon a time at
caricature, and if we are to judge him by these attempts, we should
pronounce him the worst French caricaturist the world ever saw,
which would be saying a great deal; for a worse school than that of
the modern French caricaturists (and I do not except even Gavarni,
Cham, or Daumier), does not anywhere exist. That this man of
marvellous genius had humour I do not for one moment deny; but
it was the grim humour of an inquisitor or torturer of the middle
ages&mdash;of one that revels in a perfect nightmare of terror.<a name="FnAnchor_6" href="#Footnote_6"><span class="sp">6</span></a> Genius
is said to be nearly allied to madness; and if one studies some of
his weird creations&mdash;such, for instance, as <i>The Judgment Day</i> in the
legend of &ldquo;The Wandering Jew&rdquo;&mdash;the thought involuntarily suggests
itself that a brain teeming with such marvellous and often morbid
conceptions, might have been pushed off its balance at any moment.
Gustave Doré delights in lofty, mediæval-gabled buildings, with
bartizans and antique galleries; in steep streets, dominated by
gloomy turrets; in narrow entries, terminating in dark vistas; in
gloomy forests, crowded with rocky pinnacles; in masses of struggling,
mutilated men and horses; in monstrous forms of creeping,
crawling, slimy, ghastly horror. By the side of the conceptions of
Gustave Doré&mdash;<i>teste</i> for instance the weird pictures of &ldquo;The Wandering
Jew&rdquo; already mentioned&mdash;George Cruikshank sinks at times into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>9</span>
insignificance; and yet side by side with George Cruikshank, as a
purely comic artist or caricaturist, Doré is beneath mediocrity.</p>

<p>Artists and art critics not unnaturally regard caricature with some
<span class="sn">Mr. Hamerton&rsquo;s observations on Caricature.</span>
disfavour. &ldquo;Art,&rdquo; says Hamerton, &ldquo;with a great social or political
purpose, is seldom pure fine art; artistic aims are usually lost sight
of in the anxiety to hit the social or political mark, and though the
caricaturist may have great natural facility for art, it has not a fair
chance of cultivation.&rdquo; Writing of Cruikshank&rsquo;s &ldquo;etchings&rdquo; (and
I presume he refers to those which are marked with comic or
satirical characteristics), he says: &ldquo;They are full of keen satire and
happy invention, and their moral purpose is always good; but all
these qualities are compatible with a carelessness of art which is not
to be tolerated in any one but a professional caricaturist.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_7" href="#Footnote_7"><span class="sp">7</span></a> Now
all this is true, and moreover it is fairly and generously stated; on
the other hand, Mr. Hamerton will probably admit that no artist
is likely to succeed in graphic satire, unless he be a man of marked
artistic power and invention.</p>

<p>While treating incidentally of the etchings of artists who have
distinguished themselves as graphic satirists or designers, with
etching itself as an <i>art</i> this work has no concern. For those who
would be initiated into the mysteries of etching and dry point,
negative and positive processes, soft grounds, mordants, or the like,
the late Thomas Hood has left behind him a whimsical sketch of
the process, which, imperfect as it is, will not only suffice for our
purpose, but has the merit probably of being but little known:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>

<p>&ldquo;Prepared by a hand that is skilful and nice,</p>
<p>The fine point glides along like a skate on the ice,</p>
      <p class="i3">At the will of the gentle designer,</p>
<p>Who, impelling the needle, just presses so much,</p>
<p>That each line of her labour <i>the copper may touch</i>,</p>
      <p class="i3">As if done by a penny-a-liner.</p>

<p style="letter-spacing: 3em;">&nbsp;*****</p>

<p>Certain objects however may come in your sketch,</p>
<p>Which, designed by a hand unaccustomed to etch,</p>
      <p class="i3">With a luckless result may be branded;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>10</span></p>
<p>Wherefore add this particular rule to your code,</p>
<p>Let all vehicles take the <i>wrong</i> side of the road,</p>
      <p class="i3">And man, woman, and child be <i>left-handed</i>.</p>

<p class="s">Yet regard not the awkward appearance with doubt,</p>

      <p class="i3">That at first seemed no better than curses:</p>
<p>So, till <i>things take a turn</i>, live in hope, and depend</p>

<p>Effervesces, you trace the completed design</p>
      <p class="i3">In an elegant bead-work of bubbles.</p>

<p style="letter-spacing: 3em;">&nbsp;*****</p>

<p>But before with the varnishing brush you proceed,</p>
<p>Let the plate with cold water be thoroughly freed</p>
      <p class="i3">From the other less innocent liquor;</p>
<p>After which, on whatever you want to protect,</p>
<p>Put a <i>coat</i> that will act to that very effect,</p>
      <p class="i3">Like the black one which hangs on the vicar.</p>

<p class="s">Then the varnish well dried&mdash;urge the biting again,</p>
<p>But how long, at its meal, the <i>eau forte</i> may remain,</p>
      <p class="i3">Time and practice alone can determine:</p>
<p>But of course not so long that the mountain, and mill,</p>
<p>The rude bridge, and the figures&mdash;whatever you will&mdash;</p>
      <p class="i3">Are as black as the spots on your ermine.</p>

<p class="s">It is true, none the less, that a dark looking scrap,</p>
<p>With a sort of Blackheath and Black Forest, mayhap,</p>
      <p class="i3">Is considered as rather Rembrandty;</p>
<p>And that very black cattle and very black sheep,</p>
<p>A black dog, and a shepherd as black as a sweep,</p>
      <p class="i3">Are the pets of some great <i>dilettante</i>.</p>

<p style="letter-spacing: 3em;">&nbsp;*****</p>

<p>But before your own picture arrives at that pitch,</p>
<p>While the lights are still light, and the shadows, though rich.</p>
      <p class="i3">More transparent than ebony shutters,</p>
<p>Never minding what Black-Arted critics may say,</p>
<p>Stop the biting, and pour the green blind away,</p>
      <p class="i3">As you please, into bottles or gutters.</p>

<p class="s"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>11</span></p>
<p>Then removing the ground and the wax <i>at a heat</i>,</p>
<p>Cleanse the surface with oil, spermaceti or sweet&mdash;</p>
      <p class="i3">For your hand a performance scarce proper&mdash; </p>

      <p class="i3">To assist you in <i>cleaning the copper</i>.</p>

<p style="letter-spacing: 3em;">&nbsp;*****</p>

<p>Thus your etching complete, it remains but to hint</p>
<p>That with certain assistance from paper and print,</p>
      <p class="i3">Which the proper mechanic will settle,</p>
<p>You may charm all your friends&mdash;without any sad tale</p>

<h5><i>MISCELLANEOUS CARICATURES AND SUBJECTS OF

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Although</span> Gillray began his work in 1769,&mdash;thirty years before
<span class="sn">Proposed method Of Arrangement.</span>
our century commenced, and Rowlandson five years later on, in
1774, their labours were continued some years after 1799, and are
so interwoven, so to speak, with the work of their immediate
successors, that it is almost impossible in a work dealing with
nineteenth century caricaturists to omit all mention of them. In
collecting too materials for the present treatise, we necessarily met
with many anonymous satires, without signature, initials, or distinguishing
style, which may be, and some of which are probably due
to artists whose pencils were at work before the century began.
Even if equal in all cases to the task of assigning these satires to
the particular hands which designed and executed them, we submit
that little real service would be rendered to the cause of graphic
satire. It appears to us therefore that the most convenient method
will be to indicate in this and the following chapters <i>some</i> of the
leading topics of caricature during the first thirty years of the
century, and to cite in illustration of our subject such of the work
of anonymous or other artists, for which no better place can be
assigned in other divisions of the work.</p>

<p>The attention of the public during the first fifteen years of the
century was mainly directed to the progress and fortunes of the
great national enemy, Napoleon Bonaparte. The hatred with which
he was regarded in this country can scarcely be appreciated in these
days; and in order that the cause of this bitter antipathy may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>13</span>
understood, it will be necessary for us to consider Bonaparte&rsquo;s
general policy in relation to ourselves.</p>

<p>The close of the century had been signalized in France by the
<span class="sn">18th Brumaire.</span>
memorable revolution of &ldquo;the eighteenth Brumaire.&rdquo; The Directory
had ceased to exist, and a provisional consular commission, consisting
of &ldquo;Citizens&rdquo; Sieyes, Ducos, and Bonaparte, was appointed.
On the 13th of December, the legislative committees presented the
new constitution to the nation, the votes against it being 1,562 as
against 3,012,659 in its favour. Bonaparte was nominated first
consul for ten, and Cambacères and Lebrun (nominal) second and
third consuls for five years.</p>

<p>Although Bonaparte, as soon as he was appointed First Consul,
made direct overtures to the king of England with a view to
peace, he had himself to thank if his overtures met with no corresponding
return. To accomplish the revolution of the &ldquo;eighteenth
Brumaire,&rdquo; he had found it necessary to quit Egypt. The English
knew the French occupation of Egypt was intended as a direct
menace to British interests in India. Lord Granville, therefore, in
his official reply, without assuming to prescribe a form of government
to France, plainly but somewhat illogically intimated that the
&ldquo;restoration of the ancient line of princes, under whom France had
enjoyed so many centuries of prosperity, would afford the best
possible guarantee for the maintenance of peace between the two
countries.&rdquo; This New Year&rsquo;s greeting on the part of Lord Granville
put an end, as might have been expected, to all further communications.</p>

<p>The French, however, had no business in Egypt, and England
was resolved at any cost to drive them out of that country. With
this object in view, the armament under the command of Sir Ralph
Abercrombie effected its disembarkation at Aboukir on the 8th
of March, 1801. A severe though indecisive action followed five
days afterwards. On the 20th was fought the decisive battle of
Alexandria. General Hutchinson, on the death of the English
commander, followed up the victory with so much vigour and
celerity, that early in the autumn the French army capitulated, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>14</span>
<span class="sn">The French driven out of Egypt.</span>
condition of being conveyed to France with all its arms, artillery,
and baggage. The capitulation was signed just in time to save
French honour; for immediately after the conclusion of the treaty,
a second British force, under the command of Sir David Baird,
arrived from India by way of the Red Sea. Bonaparte&rsquo;s favourite
project of making Egypt an <i>entrepôt</i> for the conquest of Hindostan
was thus most effectually checkmated.<a name="FnAnchor_9" href="#Footnote_9"><span class="sp">9</span></a></p>

<p>On the 1st of October, 1801, <i>preliminaries</i> of peace between
France and Great Britain were signed in Downing Street; on the
10th, General Lauriston, aide-de-camp to the First Consul, having
arrived with the ratification of these preliminaries, the populace
took the horses from his carriage and drew it to Downing Street.
That night and the following there was a general illumination
in London.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;preliminaries&rdquo; referred to were those of the very unsatisfactory
&ldquo;Peace of Amiens,&rdquo; as it was called. Its terms, by no means
flattering to this country, were shortly these: France was to retain
all her conquests; while, on the other hand, the acquisitions made
by England during the war were to be given up. Malta and its
dependencies were to be restored (under certain restrictions) nominally
to the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem; the French were
to evacuate Naples and the Roman States; and the British Porto
Ferrago, and all the ports possessed by them in the Mediterranean
and the Adriatic.</p>

<p>All this time a violent paper war had been maintained between
the English press and the <i>Moniteur</i>, the official organ of the
Consular Government. In the month of August, 1802, Bonaparte
prohibited the circulation of the English newspapers, and immediately
after the issue of the order, the coffee houses and reading
rooms were visited by his police, who carried away every English
journal upon which they could lay their hands. By way of answer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>15</span>
<span class="sn">Bonaparte establishes an English Newspaper in Paris.</span>
to English abuse (to which Napoleon was singularly sensitive), the
First Consul now established an English newspaper in Paris, which
was thenceforth unceasingly occupied in vilifying the Government
and people of England. This paper was called <i>The Argus</i>, and
an Englishman, one Goldsmith,&mdash;whilom proprietor of the <i>Albion</i>
newspaper in London,&mdash;was actually found mean enough to
undertake the peculiarly dirty office of its editor.</p>

<p>The <i>denouement</i> was not long delayed. On the 13th of March,
1803, occurred the extraordinary and well-known scene between the
First Consul and the English ambassador, Lord Whitworth. Bonaparte,
in the presence of a numerous and astonished Court,
vehemently accused England of breach of faith in not carrying out
the provisions of the treaty, by still remaining in possession of
Malta. The episode appears to have been of an extraordinary
character, and the violence and ferocity of Bonaparte&rsquo;s language
and behaviour, maintained till the very close of the interview,
must have contrasted strangely with the coolness of the English
ambassador.</p>

<p>The restoration of Malta to the Knights of St. John was of
course a mere nominal restitution, for, except in name, the Knights
of St. John had ceased to exist. The First Consul really wanted
the island for himself; and while he accused us of breach of faith,
was himself acting all the while contrary to the spirit of the treaty
of Amiens. While requiring that we should drive the royalist
emigrants from our shores, he demanded that the English press
should be deprived of its liberty of speaking in such frank terms
of himself and his policy. His unfriendly conduct did not end here.
At this very time he was actively employed in fomenting rebellion
in Ireland, and in planting (under the nominal character of consuls)
spies along our coast, whose treacherous objects were accidentally
discovered by the seizure of the secret instructions issued to one of
these fellows at Dublin. &ldquo;You are required,&rdquo; said this precious
document, &ldquo;to furnish a plan of the ports of your district, with a
specification of the soundings for mooring vessels. If no plan
of the ports can be procured, you are to point out with what wind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>16</span>
vessels can come in and go out, and what is the greatest draught
of water with which vessels can enter the river deeply laden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still there was no actual breach of the nominal peace between
the two countries until the 12th of May, on which day Lord
Whitworth left Paris. He landed at Dover on the 20th, meeting
there General Audreossi, Napoleon&rsquo;s minister to the English Court,
on the point of embarking for France.</p>

<p>For two days before, that is to say on the 18th of May, 1803,
<span class="sn">England declares War.</span>
England had issued her declaration of war against France. In this
document, our government alleged that the surrender of Malta to the
knights of St. John of Jerusalem had been rendered impossible by the
action of France and Spain, who had destroyed the independence
of the Order itself. Reference was made to Bonaparte&rsquo;s attempts
to interfere with the liberty of the English press, and the indignities
he had offered to our ambassador; but the real ground of quarrel
was to be found in an official gasconade of Bonaparte&rsquo;s, in which he
declared that &ldquo;Britain could not contend single handed against
France,&rdquo; a vainglorious boast, which (in those days at least) touched
a chord which thrilled the patriotic feelings of every Englishman that
loved his country.</p>

<p>Napoleon&rsquo;s next step&mdash;a simply detestable action&mdash;was quite in
accordance with the faithless policy which he pursued towards this
country. The treaty of Amiens had induced crowds of English to
cross the Channel, and on the specious pretext that two French
ships had been captured prior to the actual declaration of war, he
issued a decree on the 22nd of May, 1803, for the arrest and imprisonment
of all Englishmen in France, over eighteen and under
sixty years of age, all subjects of the king of England between those
ages being considered, for the purpose of this outrageous order,
<i>as forming part of the English militia</i>. This measure was carried
out with the utmost rigour, and the eleven thousand English who
thus became prisoners of war were deprived of their liberty fifteen
years, and regained it only in 1814.</p>

<p>The feeling of the nation at this time may be judged by the
debates in the Houses of Parliament. In the Commons, Mr. Grey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>17</span>
<span class="sn">English Enthusiasm.</span>
moved an amendment, which, while it assured His Majesty of
support in the war, expressed <i>disapprobation of the conduct of Ministers</i>.
This amendment was rejected by 398 to 67. The unanimity in
the Lords was still greater. The official statement that England was
unable to contend single-handed with France produced a violent
outburst of indignation, and the amendment moved by Lord King, to
omit words which charged France with the actual guilt and responsibility
of breaking the treaty, was negatived by 142 to 10. This was
on the 23rd of May. On the 20th of June a great meeting was
held at Lloyds, for the purpose of promoting a subscription for
carrying on the war. Six days later on, five thousand merchants,
bankers, and other persons of position met at the Royal Exchange,
and unanimously agreed to a declaration which expressed their
determination to &ldquo;stand or fall with their king and country.&rdquo; This
resolution or declaration was seconded by the Secretary to the East
India Company, and the meeting did not separate until &ldquo;God save
the King&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rule Britannia&rdquo; had been sung, and nine cheers
had been given for England and King George. On the 26th of
August, His Majesty reviewed the London volunteers in Hyde Park,
in the presence of the French princes, General Dumouriez, and two
hundred thousand spectators; this military spectacle being followed
on the 28th by a review, in the same place, of the Westminster,
Lambeth, and Southwark corps. The number of volunteers actually
enrolled in the metropolis and outparishes at this time was forty-six
thousand.</p>

<p>The following year saw the final end of the great French Revolution;
the names of the puppet &ldquo;second&rdquo; and &ldquo;third&rdquo; consuls had
been long omitted from the public acts of the French Government.
The motives of this omission were soon abundantly apparent; and
in the month of May, 1804, Bonaparte was proclaimed Emperor of
the French.</p>

<p>Some writers have doubted whether Napoleon entertained any
serious intention of invading this country; but to doubt such
intention would be really to doubt whether Nelson fell at Trafalgar,
for that crushing defeat was simply the sequel and outcome of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>18</span>
collapse of the emperor&rsquo;s plans. The details of the invasion scheme
were fully explained to General Sir Neil Campbell by Napoleon
himself at Elba, in 1814, and afterwards confirmed by him in
precisely similar terms to O&rsquo;Meara at St. Helena. Those plans were
defeated by the suspicions and vigilance of Lord Nelson; by his
habit of acting promptly upon his suspicions; by the alacrity with
which the Admiralty of the day obeyed his warnings; by the
prescience of Lord Collingwood; and by the consequent intercepting
of the combined French and Spanish fleets off Ferrol by Sir
Robert Calder, in July, 1806. The moment this happened, Napoleon
saw that his game&mdash;so far at least as England was concerned&mdash;was at
an end; and fertile in resources, he immediately carried out the
second part of his programme. Then followed, as we know, the
campaign of Austerlitz, the treaty of Presburg, the war with Prussia,
and finally the battle of Jena, in October, 1806.</p>

<p>Ever bent on humiliating and crippling the resources of
<span class="sn">Berlin Decree.</span>
England, Napoleon on the 1st of November, 1806, issued his
memorable &ldquo;Berlin Decree,&rdquo; containing eleven clauses, of which
this country formed the exclusive topic. By it, all trade and correspondence
with the British Isles was prohibited; all letters and
packets at the post office, addressed to England, or to an Englishman,
or &ldquo;written in English,&rdquo; were to be seized; every subject of
England found <i>in any</i> of the countries occupied by French troops
or those of their allies, was to be made prisoner of war; all warehouses,
merchandise, and property belonging to a subject of
England were declared lawful prize; all trading in English
merchandise forbidden; every article belonging to England, or
coming from her colonies, or of her manufacture, was declared good
prize; and English vessels were excluded from every European
port.<a name="FnAnchor_10" href="#Footnote_10"><span class="sp">10</span></a> This outrageous &ldquo;decree&rdquo; Bonaparte imposed upon every
country that fell under the iron sway of his military despotism.</p>

<p>The policy, therefore, of the emperor towards England, which
was contrary to all the usages of civilized warfare, will explain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>19</span>
<span class="sn">Base Policy of Bonaparte.</span>
the bitter animosity with which he was regarded in this country.
The English were molested everywhere; they were made prisoners
at Verdun and in Holland; their property was confiscated in Portugal;
Russia was cajoled, Prussia forced into a league against
them, and Sweden menaced, because she persisted in maintaining
her alliance with this country. The &ldquo;Berlin Decree&rdquo; was an
infamous document, worthy rather the policy of a bandit chief than
of a fair and honourable antagonist. It proclaimed war not against
individuals, but against private property, and specially appealed
to the cupidity of those to whom it was addressed. This base
policy towards English subjects recoiled inevitably against its
perpetrator; and its effects were soon felt in the fields of the
Peninsula, the banishment to Elba, and above all, in the final
consignment to the rock of St. Helena. We, on our part, ignored
Bonaparte&rsquo;s right to the title of emperor. With us, he was invariably
&ldquo;General Bonaparte,&rdquo; and nothing more; and in the graphic
lampoons of Gillray, Rowlandson, and Cruikshank, he was exhibited
under the most ludicrous circumstances in connection with the
divorce, the defeats of Russia and the Peninsula, and even the
paternity of his son the young king of Rome. These caricatures
were brought to his notice by his spies and emissaries in England;
they rendered him furious; and one of them&mdash;Gillray&rsquo;s admirable
and, as it subsequently proved, prophetic satire of <i>The Handwriting
on the Wall</i>&mdash;is said to have given him not only offence, but even
serious uneasiness.</p>

<p>The tone of the English caricaturists may be gathered from one
of the best of Woodward&rsquo;s satires, published in 1807. It is entitled
<i>A Political Fair</i>, in which the various shows are labelled Russian,
Danish, Swedish, Westphalian, Austrian, Dutch, Spanish, and even
American. The best show in the fair is kept of course by John
Bull &amp; Co., whilst Bonaparte is the proprietor of a humble stall,
whereat gingerbread kings and queens are sold wholesale and retail
by his Imperial Majesty.<a name="FnAnchor_11" href="#Footnote_11"><span class="sp">11</span></a> The same artist, in another but distinctly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>20</span>
inferior satire (published in November, 1807), gives us <i>The Gallick
Storehouse for English Shipping</i>: on one side we see Napoleon
accumulating vast stores of Spanish, Danish, Dutch, and Swedish
vessels, intended to annihilate the naval power of England&mdash;the
shipbuilder, however, shrugs his shoulders and suggests it is but time
thrown away, for as fast as the ships are built, John Bull &ldquo;claps
them into his storehouse over the way.&rdquo; The satire was suggested
of course by the victory of Trafalgar in October, 1805; by Sir
J. Duckworth&rsquo;s capture of French shipping in January, 1806; and
by the surrender of the Danish fleet after the bombardment of
Copenhagen, in September, 1807.<a name="FnAnchor_12" href="#Footnote_12"><span class="sp">12</span></a></p>

<p>In a caricature published by Walker in 1808, we see Joseph
Bonaparte (one of these Imperial ginger-bread monarchs) driven
from Madrid by Spanish flies; the satire is entitled <i>Spanish Flies,
or Boney taking an Immoderate Dose</i>, and has reference to the results
of the Battle of Baylen, in Andalusia, one of the <i>very</i> few victories
<span class="sn">Battle of Baylen.</span>
ever obtained by the Spaniards against the French, where a division
of 14,000 men surrendered to Castanos. This was on the 20th
of July, and nine days afterwards Joseph retreated to Burgos with
the crown jewels. The wretched Spaniards, however, were incapable
of improving their victory; and General Castanos instead of following
up the retreating enemy, went to Seville to fulfil a vow he
had made of dedicating his unexpected victory to St. Ferdinand,
on whose tomb he deposited the crown of laurel presented to him
by his grateful countrymen. Of the Bonaparte caricatures of this
year, no less than nineteen are due to the pencil of Thomas
Rowlandson, and will be found fully described in Mr. Joseph
Grego&rsquo;s exhaustive work<a name="FnAnchor_13" href="#Footnote_13"><span class="sp">13</span></a> upon that artist and his works.</p>

<p>The year 1809 witnessed the divorce from Josephine, and the
marriage of the emperor to Marie Louise. The purposes for which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>21</span>
this matrimonial alliance was effected were made no secret of by
the emperor, and were indicated of course in the plainest possible
terms by the English contemporary caricaturists, who were certainly
not troubled with any unnecessary scruples of prudery or delicacy.
One of these satires, published by Tegg, on the 16th of August,
1810, is entitled <i>Boney and his New Wife, or a Quarrel about
Nothing</i>, and indicates in the plainest possible terms that the purposes
for which the divorce had been effected were as distant as ever.
The result of this union, however, was the birth of the young king
of Rome on the 20th of March, 1810, an event which set the pencils
of our pictorial satirists once more in motion, and the young heir
and his father were complimented by Rowlandson in a rough
caricature, published by Tegg on the 9th of April, 1811, as <i>Boney
the Second, the little Babboon</i> [sic] <i>created to devour French Monkies</i>.</p>

<p>In March, 1811, was fought the battle of Barossa; while the
<span class="sn">Battle of Barossa.</span>
same month Massena, finding it difficult to maintain his army in a
devastated country, instead of fulfilling his vain-glorious boast of
driving &ldquo;the English into their native element,&rdquo; began his own
retreat from Santarem, abandoning part of his baggage and heavy
artillery. Marching in a solid mass, his rear protected by one or
two divisions, he retired towards the Mondego, preserving his army
from any great serious disaster, though watchfully and vigorously
pursued by Lord Wellington. The skilful generalship of the French
marshal elicited of course no encomiums from the English caricaturists.
On the contrary, we see (in &ldquo;The Scourge&rdquo; of 1st May,
1811) Wellington in the act of basting a French goose before a huge
fire, a British bayonet forming the spit. While basting the goose
with one hand, the English general holds over the fire in the other a
frying-pan filled with French generals, some of whom&mdash;to escape the
overpowering heat&mdash;are leaping into the fire; another British officer
(probably intended for General Graham) blows the flames with a
pair of bellows labelled &ldquo;British bravery.&rdquo; Napoleon appears in a
stew-pan over an adjoining boiler, while we find Marshal Massena
himself in a pickle-jar below. This satire is entitled, <i>British
Cookery, or Out of the Frying-pan into the Fire</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>22</span></p>

<p>The star of Napoleon was beginning to wane in 1812. The snow
<span class="sn">Napoleon&rsquo;s Star begins to wane.</span>
made its first appearance in Russia on the 13th of October of that
year, and the French emperor already commenced his preparations
for retreat. This is referred to in a very clever caricature published
by Tegg on the 1st of December, 1812, wherein we find <i>General
Frost shaving Boney</i> with a razor marked &ldquo;Russian steel.&rdquo; Napoleon
stands up to his knees in snow, and out of the nostrils of the snow
fiend [General Frost] issue blasts labelled &ldquo;North,&rdquo; &ldquo;East,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Snow,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sleet.&rdquo; Seven days later on, we meet with a roughly-executed
cartoon, <i>Polish Diet with French Dessert</i>, wherein we see
Napoleon basted by General Benningsen, the spit being turned by a
Russian bear. This caricature, no doubt, has reference to the
disastrous defeat by Benningsen of the French advanced guard,
thirty thousand strong, under Murat, on the 18th of October, 1812,
when fifteen hundred prisoners, thirty-eight cannon, and the whole
of the baggage of the corps, besides other trophies, fell into the
victors&rsquo; hands.</p>

<p>The retreat from Moscow is referred to in a satire published by
Thomas Tegg on the 7th of March, 1813, labelled, <i>The Corsican
Bloodhound beset by the Bears of Russia</i>; wherein Napoleon is
represented as a mongrel bloodhound with a tin kettle tied to his
tail, closely pursued by Russian bears. Various papers are flying
out of the kettle, labelled &ldquo;Oppression,&rdquo; &ldquo;Famine,&rdquo; &ldquo;Frost,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Destruction,&rdquo; &ldquo;Death,&rdquo; &ldquo;Horror,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mortality,&rdquo; &ldquo;Annihilation.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Push on, my lads,&rdquo; says one of the pursuers. &ldquo;No grumbling;
keep scent of him; no sucking of paws this winter, here is food for the
bears in all the Russias.&rdquo; The emperor, in truth, had the narrowest
escape from being made a prisoner by the Cossacks, a fact alluded to
in another caricature published by Tegg in June, 1813, entitled, <i>Nap
nearly Nab&rsquo;d, or a Retreating Jump just in time</i>. Here, the emperor
and one of his marshals are depicted leaping out of window, at the
very moment when a Cossack with his lance appears outside the
palings. &ldquo;Vite,&rdquo; says the marshal, in the peculiar <i>patois</i> adopted
by the English caricaturists of the early part of the century, &ldquo;Courez,
mon Empereur, ce Diable de Cossack, dey spoil our dinner!!!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>23</span></p>

<p>Napoleon collected his marshals around him at Smorgoni, on the
<span class="sn">The Bulletin.</span>
5th of December, 1812, and dictated a bulletin which developed
the horrors of the retreat, and explained to them his reasons for
returning to Paris. &ldquo;I quit you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but go to seek three
hundred thousand men.&rdquo; He then proceeded to lay the blame on
the King of Westphalia, and his trusted and tried friend the Duc
d&rsquo;Abrantes; alleged that English torches had turned Moscow into
a heap of ashes; and added (with greater truthfulness) that the cold
had done the rest of the mischief. He entrusted the command to
Murat, and bidding them farewell set out, accompanied only by
Generals Coulaincourt, Duroc, and Mouton, the Mameluke Rustan,
a captain of the Polish lancers, and an escort of Neapolitan horsemen.
This event is referred to in a caricature, published by S. W.
Fores on the 1st of January, 1813, entitled, <i>Boney returning from
Russia covered with Glory, leaving his army in comfortable winter
quarters</i>. Napoleon and Coulaincourt are seated in a sleigh driven
by another general in jack boots, with a tremendous cocked hat on
his head, a huge sword by his side, and a formidable whip in his
hand. Coulaincourt inquires, &ldquo;Will your Majesty write the
bulletin?&rdquo; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replies Napoleon; &ldquo;you write it. Tell them we
left the army all well, quite gay; in excellent quarters; plenty of
provisions; that we travelled in great style; received everywhere
with congratulations; and that I had almost completed the <i>repose</i> of
Europe&rdquo; (a favourite expression of his). By way of contrast to these
grandiloquent phrases, the eye is attracted to the surroundings.
The ground is thickly coated with snow; in the foreground, two
famished wretches cut and devour raw flesh from a dead horse. On
all sides lie dead and dying men and animals, while in the distance
we behold the flying and demoralized troops chased by a cloud of
Cossacks. The English caricaturists follow the emperor into the
sanctity of his private life; they depict in their own homely but
forcible fashion the astonishment of the empress at his unexpected
return, and the disgust of young &ldquo;Boney the Second,&rdquo; who not only
expresses surprise that his imperial sire had forgotten his promise to
&ldquo;bring him some Russians to cut up,&rdquo; but suggests that they seem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>24</span>
to have &ldquo;cut <i>him</i> up&rdquo; instead. These incidents are described in
a satire entitled, <i>Nap&rsquo;s Glorious Return; or, the Conclusion of the
Russian campaign</i>, published by Tegg, in June, 1813.</p>

<p>The crushing defeat of Vitoria, the crowning disaster of Leipzig&mdash;sustained
the same year, the subsequent abdication of Bonaparte,
the return from Elba, the brief incident of the &ldquo;hundred days,&rdquo; the
catastrophe of Waterloo, and the subsequent consignment of the
great emperor to St. Helena, form of course the subjects of a host
of graphic satires. Foremost amongst them (for Gillray&rsquo;s intellect
was gone), must be mentioned the caricatures of Thomas Rowlandson
and of George Cruikshank. The first being fully described in
Mr. Grego&rsquo;s work, we are not called on to mention them here, while
the last will be fully set out when we come to treat of the caricature
work of George Cruikshank.</p>

<p>The French royalist satirists of course expressed their views on
<span class="sn">French Royalist Satires.</span>
the situation. A French royalist caricature, published after Waterloo,
represents Napoleon as a dancing bear forced to caper by
England, his keeper, who makes an unsparing use of the lash, whilst
Russia and Prussia play pipe and drum by way of music. A good
answer, however, to this is found in a French caricature (published
in the Napoleon interest), like most of the French satires of that
period without date, entitled, <i>L&rsquo;après dinée des Anglais, par un
Français prisonnier-de-guerre</i>, which satirizes the after-dinner drinking
propensities of the English of the period. The caricature, although
neither flattering nor altogether decent, is probably not an exaggerated
picture of English after-dinner conviviality while the
century was young.</p>

<p>By far the most biting, the most sarcastic, the most effective, and
the most popular of the anti-Bonaparte caricatures are those by
James Gillray, which commence before the close of the last century,
and end in 1811, the year when the lurid genius of this greatest and
most original of satirists was quenched in the darkness of mental
imbecility. James Gillray, however, like his able friend and contemporary,
Thomas Rowlandson, does not fall within our definition
of a &ldquo;nineteenth century&rdquo; satirist; and I am precluded from describing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>25</span>
them. I have before me the admirable anti-Bonaparte satires
of both artists; and inseparably linked as they are with the men who
began work after 1800, the almost irresistible tendency is to describe
some of them in elucidation of the events to which I have occasion
to refer. To do so, however, although fascinating and easy, would be
not only to wander from my purpose, but to invade the province of
the late Thomas Wright and of Mr. Grego, which I am not called
upon to do; to refer to them, however, for the purpose of this
chapter, I have found not only necessary, but unavoidable.</p>

<p>Caricature, like literary satire (as we all know from the days of
<span class="sn">Injustice of the Caricaturists.</span>
the &ldquo;Dunciad&rdquo; downwards), has little concern with justice; but we
who look back after the lapse of the greater part of the century, and
have moreover studied the history and the surroundings of Napoleon
Bonaparte, may afford at least to do him justice. Gillray is a fair
exponent of the intense hatred with which Bonaparte was regarded
in this country, when not only the little &ldquo;Corsican,&rdquo; but those about
him, were held up to a ridicule which, oftentimes vulgar, partook
not unfrequently of absolute brutality. Who would imagine, for
instance, that the fat blousy female quaffing deep draughts of Maraschino
from a goblet, in his famous satire of the <i>Handwriting on the
Wall</i>, was intended for the refined and delicate Josephine? Occasionally,
however, James Gillray descended to a lower depth, as in
his <i>Ci Devant Occupations</i> (of 20th February, 1805), in which we
see this delicate woman, with the frail but lovely Spaniard, Theresa
de Cabarrus (Madame Tallien), figuring in a manner to which the
most infamous women of Drury Lane would have hesitated to
descend. Josephine de la Pagerie, as we all know, was anything but
blameless; which indeed of <i>les Déesses de la Revolution</i> could pass
unscathed through the fiery furnace of the Terror?<a name="FnAnchor_14" href="#Footnote_14"><span class="sp">14</span></a> But this miscalled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>26</span>
satire of James Gillray, which he dubs &ldquo;a fact,&rdquo; is nothing
<span class="sn">They mistake the character of Bonaparte.</span>
less than a poisonous libel. As for <i>le petit Caporal</i> himself, everyone
now knows, that while he viewed the carnage of the battlefield
with the indifference of a conqueror, he shrank in horror from the
murderers of the Swiss; from Danton and his satellites, the Septembrist
massacrists; from the mock trials and cold-blooded atrocities
of the Terrorists. Standing apart from these last by right of his
unexampled genius, with Danton, Marat, Robespíerre, Couthon,
Carrier, Napoleon Bonaparte has nothing whatever in common.
Looking back upon the ruins of his empire, the mistakes he had
made, the faults he had committed, Napoleon, with reference
at least to his own personal elevation, might say with truth:
&ldquo;Nothing has been more simple than my elevation. It was not
the result of intrigue or <i>crime</i>. It was owing to the peculiar circumstance
of the times, and because I fought successfully against
the enemies of my country. What is most extraordinary is, that
I rose from being a private person to the astonishing height of
power I possessed, without having committed a single crime to
obtain it. If I were on my death-bed I could make the same
declaration.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_15" href="#Footnote_15"><span class="sp">15</span></a></p>

<p>To these facts, of course, James Gillray (if indeed he knew them)
closed his eyes. In his sketch of the 12th of May, 1800, he shows
us the young lieutenant at the head of tattered legions directing
the destruction of the royal palaces. Blinded by the prejudice
of his times, he seems apparently ignorant of the fact that Napoleon
although a <i>spectator</i> of the attack on the Tuileries, had no power;
that if he had, he would (as he himself expressed it at the time) have
swept the sanguinary <i>canaille</i> into the gutters with his grape shot.
Again, in his satires, he connects him repeatedly with the guillotine,
to all appearance unconscious of the fact that between Napoleon
and the guillotine no possible sympathy existed.</p>

<p>A good idea of the appearance and costume of &ldquo;the general&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>27</span>
<span class="sn">Robert Dighton&rsquo;s Sketches.</span>
and notables of the early part of the century, is given by the sketches
of the last century artist, Robert Dighton. His etchings are not
caricatures, as may be supposed, but likenesses of the <i>oi polloi</i>&mdash;the
university dons&mdash;the prize-fighters&mdash;the butchers&mdash;the singers&mdash;actors&mdash;actresses&mdash;the
men about town (&ldquo;Corinthians,&rdquo; as they
were termed in the slang of the Regency)&mdash;the &ldquo;upper ten&rdquo;; and
what amazingly queer folks were these last! The Duke of Grafton,
with his tremendous beak, wig, and cocked hat, his mahogany tops
and spurs, his long coat with the flapped pockets and his star; the
Marquis of Buckingham, with his red fat face and double chin,
which told tales of nightly good cheer, his cocked hat, military
coatee, and terrific paunch, which resisted all attempts to confine
it within reasonable military compass; John Bellingham&mdash;the murderer
of Spencer Perceval,&mdash;with his retreating forehead, long pointed
nose, drab cloth coat and exuberant shirt frill; &ldquo;What? What?
What?&rdquo;&mdash;Great George himself, as he appeared in 1810, in full
military panoply&mdash;huge ill-fitting boots, huge blue military coat,
collar, lappets, and star, a white-powdered bob surmounting a
clean-shaved unintellectual face, the distinguishing characteristics
of which were a pair of protruding eyes surmounted by ponderous
eyebrows.</p>

<p>A well-drawn caricature published by S. W. Fores on the 11th
of May, 1801, gives us an admirable idea of the male and female
costume of the period. It contains sixteen figures, and is entitled
<i>Tea just Over, or the Game of Consequences begun</i>. &ldquo;Consequences&rdquo;
would appear to have been a fashionable game at this time; but
the &ldquo;consequences&rdquo; here alluded to are the immediate results of
a pinch of snuff. The &ldquo;consequences&rdquo; of one gentleman sneezing
are the following: he jerks the arm of the lady next him, the
result being that she pours her cup of scalding hot tea over the
knees of her neighbour, a testy old gentleman, who in his fright
and pain raises his arms, jerking off with his cane the wig of a
person standing at the back of his chair, who in the attempt to save
his wig upsets his own cup and saucer upon the pate of his antagonist
Another guest, with his mouth full of tea, witnessing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>28</span>
this absurd <i>contretemps</i> is unable to restrain his laughter, the
result of which is that he blows a stream of tea into the left ear of
the man who has lost his wig, at the same time setting his own
pigtail alight in the adjoining candle. All these disasters, passing
in rapid succession from left to right, are the direct &ldquo;consequences&rdquo;
of one unfortunate pinch of snuff.</p>

<p>The year 1804 witnessed the advent of a performer whose theatrical
reputation, notwithstanding the wonderful sensation it created for a
couple of seasons, was not destined to survive his childhood. The
brief <i>furore</i> he excited, enabled his friends to lay by for him a
considerable fortune, which enabled him to regard the memory
of his immature triumphs and subsequent failures with resignation.
Master Betty, &ldquo;the Young Roscius,&rdquo; was not quite thirteen years
<span class="sn">Master Betty.</span>
of age when he made his first appearance at Covent Garden on
the 1st of December, 1804, as Achmet in <i>Barbarossa</i>. He played
alternately at the two great houses; twenty-eight nights at Drury
Lane brought £17,210 into the treasury, whilst the receipts at
Covent Garden during the same period are supposed to have been
equally large. A rough caricature of 1804, bearing the signature
&ldquo;I. B.,&rdquo; depicts the child standing with one foot on Drury Lane
and the other on Covent Garden, with a toy whip in one hand and
a rattle in the other, while two full-grown actors of real merit
bemoan the decadence of public taste on the pavement below.
Some years later on the pair might have said with Byron,&mdash;</p>

<p>The leading home political incident of 1806 was the impeachment
and acquittal of Lord Melville, an event which is dealt
with by Gillray, and also by Rowlandson in his graphic satire of
<i>The Acquittal, or Upsetting the Porter Pot</i>, both artists alluding to
Whitbread, the brewer, the head of the advanced Liberals, and one
of the principal movers of Lord Melville&rsquo;s impeachment.</p>

<p>Gas, which now promises to be superseded in its turn by
<span class="sn">Introduction of Gas.</span>
electricity, was introduced into Boulton &amp; Watts&rsquo; foundry, at Birmingham,
as early as the year 1798, and the Lyceum Theatre was
lit with gas (by way of experiment) in 1803; it met however with
much opposition from persons interested in the conservation of
the oil trade, and made no real progress in London until 1807,
when it was introduced into Golden Lane on the 16th of August.
Pall Mall, however, was not lighted with gas until 1809, and it was
really not finally and generally introduced into London until the
year 1820. We meet with an excellent satire published by S. W.
Fores, in 1807, wherein a harlequin is depicted sitting on a rope
suspended between a couple of lamp posts. The lamps and the
hat of the figure are garnished with lighted burners; the neighbours
in the windows of the adjoining houses, the people on the pavement
below, the fowls, the dogs, the cats on the roofs, are suffocated with
the noxious vapour. The figure holds in his hand a paper, whereon
we read, &ldquo;This is the speculation to make money, £10,000 per
cent. profit all in <i>Air</i>-light air. &rsquo;Tis there, &rsquo;tis here, and &rsquo;tis gone
for ever.&rdquo; This caricature bears the title of <i>The Good Effects of
Carbonic Gas</i>. A caricature of Woodward, engraved by Rowlandson,
and published by Ackermann on the 23rd of December, 1809,
gives us <i>A Peep at the Gas Lights in Pall Mall</i>, the interest of
which chiefly centres in the eccentric form of the early street lamps.
Among the groups looking on are a wondering &ldquo;country cousin&rdquo;
and a &ldquo;serious&rdquo; companion. &ldquo;Ay, friend,&rdquo; says the latter, anxious
of course, in season and out of season, to turn the occasion to profitable
account, &ldquo;verily it is all vanity! What is <i>this</i> to the <i>inward
light</i>?&rdquo; Some more disreputable members of the community are
expressing their fears that the new light will interfere with their
own peculiar modes of livelihood.</p>

<p>A clever and somewhat remarkable woman succeeded in achieving
an unenviable notoriety in 1809. The daughter of a printer residing
in Bowl and Pin Alley, near White&rsquo;s Alley, Chancery Lane,
the remarkably intelligent girl had early attracted the notice of
friends, one of whom placed her at a boarding school, where she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>30</span>
picked up an education (such as it was) sufficient to sharpen her
natural abilities. Her commencement in life was scarcely a hopeful
one. Mary Anne Thompson eloped at seventeen years of age with
one Joseph Clarke, the son of a builder on Snow Hill, and after
living with him three years married him. The marriage was not
a happy one. The pair after some years separated, and Mary Anne
was thenceforth driven to trust for her support to her own resources
and attractions.</p>

<p>These proved fully equal to the occasion. Somewhat small in
<span class="sn">Mary Anne Clarke.</span>
stature, nature had nevertheless endowed her with a remarkably
well turned figure, well shaped arms, comely features, a singularly
clear complexion, and blue eyes full of light and vivacity. Dressing
with considerable taste and elegance&mdash;utterly shameless&mdash;without
principle or character, with nothing to lose&mdash;everything to gain, the
woman was eminently fitted to succeed in the peculiar path in life
she had elected to follow. Throwing her line with all the dexterity
of an accomplished angler, she succeeded almost at her first cast
in hooking a very large fish indeed&mdash;his Royal Highness Frederick
Duke of York, Commander-in-chief, Prince-bishop of Osnaburgh,
who had attained at this time the respectable age of forty-six years.</p>

<p>Mary Anne proved, as might have been expected, an expensive
plaything. In the short space of two years, the duke seems to
have handed his mistress upwards of £5,000, besides expending
on her in payments to tradesmen for wine, furniture, and other
&ldquo;paraphernalia,&rdquo; at least £16,000 or £17,000 more. In time, as
is not unusual in matters of this kind, the duke seems to have grown
tired of his enslaver, and endeavoured to pension her off with an
annuity of £400 a year; but with the niggardliness which was so
distinguishing a characteristic of his family, payment was not only
withheld, but when the woman applied for payment, the duke was
mean and foolish enough to threaten her with prison and the pillory.
Mrs. Clarke, a woman of genius and resource, instead of being
frightened, straightway betook herself to Messrs. Wilberforce and
Whitbread, the supporters of the impeachment of Lord Melville, and
confessed to them certain irregularities of which she had been guilty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>31</span></p>

<p>Into the unsavoury revelations of Mary Anne Clarke, her traffic
in the sale of military commissions, and still worse, in a system of
ecclesiastical patronage in which she alleged his Royal Highness
connived, we need not enter. They are set out as far as is necessary
in Mr. Grego&rsquo;s book, and also in Mr. Wright&rsquo;s treatise on
James Gillray and his works. Suffice it to say, that all these
miserable exposures would have been saved, had the duke, instead
of seeking to save his pocket, paid the annuity to which the woman
was entitled. If by resigning, he thought to silence his unscrupulous
persecutor, he was quickly and unpleasantly undeceived. The
clever, unscrupulous woman had reserved her trump-card to the last.
All this time she had been engaged in preparing her &ldquo;Memoirs,&rdquo;
comprising not only the history of her transactions with his Royal
Highness, but a series of his letters, containing, it is said, anecdotes
of illustrious personages of the most curious and <i>recherché</i> description.
The immediate publication of these &ldquo;Memoirs&rdquo; having
been announced to his Royal Highness, the duke was driven in
spite of himself to effect an arrangement. For a payment of £7,000
down, an annuity of £400 for her own life, and one of £200 for
each of her daughters, the printed &ldquo;Memoirs&rdquo; (eighteen thousand
copies) were destroyed, the publication suppressed, and above all
the terrible private correspondence duly surrendered.</p>

<p>The mover of the committee of inquiry was one Wardle, colonel
of a militia regiment, who for a very brief space of time was permitted
to figure as a patriot; that he was a mere instrument in the
hands of other persons seems now abundantly clear. No sooner had
Mary Anne Clarke landed his Royal Highness, than she fixed her
hook in the jaws of the luckless colonel, who, tool as he was,
proved to be by no means a sharp one. It is obvious a woman
of Mrs. Clarke&rsquo;s character would be the last person to open her lips,
unless it was made clear to her that it would be worth her while
to do so. Her go-between in the transaction was a certain &ldquo;Major&rdquo;
Dodd. Wardle gave Mrs. Clarke £100 for present necessities, and
by way of earnest of more liberal promises which seem afterwards
to have been repudiated by his employers. Through Major Dodd,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>32</span>
the clever, unprincipled woman secured a house in Westbourne
Place, which she furnished in a style of comfortable elegance, and
succeeded by her blandishments in swindling Wardle into becoming
security for her furniture. The inevitable result of course followed.
On the 3rd July, 1809, Wright, the upholsterer, brought his action
against Wardle and recovered £1,400 damages,<a name="FnAnchor_17" href="#Footnote_17"><span class="sp">17</span></a> besides costs, &ldquo;for
furniture sold to the defendant to the use of Mary Anne Clarke.&rdquo;
The colonel, like the commander-in-chief, thus found himself not
only out-man&oelig;uvred by his clever and unscrupulous ex-ally, but
reaped the obloquy attendant on exposure and ridicule, instead of
the glorification which had at first greeted his patriotic exertions.</p>

<p>Mary Anne Clarke and the Duke of York, afforded (as might
have been expected) plenty of employment to the caricaturists.
The theme, however, is treated too grossly for description, a subject
to be regretted, as most of the satires, containing as they do admirable
portraits of the principal personages, are exceedingly clever.
The subject suited an artist who delighted in delineating the immodest
and full-blown beauties of Drury Lane; and accordingly,
more than forty caricatures on the subject of &ldquo;The Delicate Investigation,&rdquo;
as it was called, are due to the pencil of Thomas
Rowlandson.</p>

<p>In order to show the character of this infamous woman, we must
<span class="sn">The end of Mary Anne Clarke.</span>
follow her progress a little farther than either Mr. Grego or Mr.
Wright appear to have done. In February, 1814, she once more
made a public appearance: this time in the Court of Queen&rsquo;s
Bench. She seems to have got the Right Hon. William Fitzgerald,
Chancellor of the Irish Exchequer, by some means or other into
her clutches, in connection with the proceedings of 1809. By
this time, however, she had descended so low, that exposure was
threatened unless a sum of money was deposited under a stone.
In her threats, she announced her intention of &ldquo;submitting to
the public in a very short time <i>two or three volumes,</i> which might
be followed by others as opportunity should suit or circumstances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>33</span>
require.&rdquo; This threat, instead of extorting money, consigned Mary
Anne to the custody of the marshal of the King&rsquo;s Bench Prison for
the space of nine calendar months, at the end of which period she
was ordered to find securities to keep the peace for a space of three
years. It might have gone harder with the brazen woman if the proceedings
had taken any other form than that of an indictment for
libel, and if she had not admitted her fault, and in some measure
thrown herself upon the mercy of the court. The pages of history
do not appear to be sullied with the intrusion of Mary Anne Clarke&rsquo;s
name after this period.</p>

<p>The year 1811 is marked by an event which claims special record
in a work treating of English caricatures and caricaturists of the
century. In that year, James Gillray executed the last of his famous
etchings; and although mere existence was prolonged for nearly four
years afterwards, till the 1st of June, 1815, he sank in 1811 into
that hopeless and dreary state of mingled imbecility and delirium
from which the intellect of this truly great and original genius was
destined never to recover.</p>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Drury</span> Lane Theatre, which was burnt down in 1811, was rebuilt
<span class="sn">1812.</span>
the following year, and the committee, anxious to celebrate the
opening by an address of merit corresponding to the occasion,
<span class="sn">Rebuilding of Drury Lane Theatre.</span>
advertised in the papers for such a composition. Theatrical
addresses, however, as we all know by reference to a recent
occasion,<a name="FnAnchor_18" href="#Footnote_18"><span class="sp">18</span></a> are not always up to the mark; and whether the result
of their appeal was unsatisfactory, or whether&mdash;as appears not unlikely&mdash;they
were appalled by the number of competitors, which is
said to have been upwards of one hundred, not one was accepted,
the advertisers preferring to seek the assistance of Lord Byron, who
wrote the actual address which was spoken at the opening on the
10th of October, 1812. Among the competitors was a Dr. Busby,
living in Queen Anne Street, who apparently unable to realize the
fact that competent men could have the effrontery to reject his
&ldquo;monologue,&rdquo; refused to accept the verdict of the committee. A
few evenings afterwards, the audience and the company were
electrified by an unexpected sensation. Busby and his son sat in
one of the stage boxes; and the latter, to the amazement of the
audience, stepped at the end of the play from his box upon the
stage, and began to recite his father&rsquo;s nonsense, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>

<p>&ldquo;When energizing objects men pursue,</p>

<p class="noind">The question remained unanswered; for Raymond, the stage

<span class="sn">Dr. Busby&rsquo;s &ldquo;Monologue.&rdquo;</span>
manager, walked at this moment upon the stage accompanied by
a constable, and gave the amateur performer into custody. It is
said that his father, not content with this failure, actually made an
attempt to recite the &ldquo;monologue&rdquo; from his box, until hissed and
howled down by the half laughing, half indignant audience. The
circumstance is commemorated by an admirable pictorial satire
entitled, <i>A Buz in a Box, or the Poet in a Pet</i>, published by S. W.
Fores on the 21st of October, in which we see the doctor gesticulating
from his box, and imploring the audience to listen to his
&ldquo;monologue.&rdquo; Young Busby, seated on his father&rsquo;s Pegasus (an
ass), quotes one of the verses of the absurd composition, while
the animal (after the manner of its kind) answers the hisses of the
audience by elevating its heels and uttering a characteristic &ldquo;hee
haw.&rdquo; By the side of Busby junior stands the manager (Raymond),
apologetically addressing the audience. Certain pamphlets lie
scattered in front of the stage, on which are inscribed (among
others) the following doggerel:&mdash;</p>

<p>Dr. Busby was a person desirous of achieving literary notoriety
at any amount of personal inconvenience. He translated <i>Lucretius</i>,
and is said to have given public recitations, accompanied with
bread and butter and tea; but in spite of these attractions, the
public did not come and the book would not sell, facts which a
wicked wag of the period ridiculed, by inserting the following
announcement in the column of births of one of the newspapers:
&ldquo;Yesterday, at his house in Queen Anne Street, Dr. Busby of a
stillborn <i>Lucretius</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The medical profession is ridiculed in a satire published in

<span class="sn">1813.</span>
1813: <i>Doctors Differ, or Dame Nature against the College</i>.<a name="FnAnchor_19" href="#Footnote_19"><span class="sp">19</span></a> Four
physicians have quarrelled in consultation over the nature of their
patient&rsquo;s malady, and the proper mode of administering to his relief.
Unable to convince one another, they wax so warm in argument
that they speedily proceed from words to blows. &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; shouts
one (beneath the feet of the other three), &ldquo;I say it is an exfoliation
of the glands which has fallen on the membranous coils of the
intestines, and must be thrown off by an emetic.&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>I</i> say,&rdquo; says
another, raising at the same time his cane to protect his head, &ldquo;I
say it is a pleurisie in the thigh, and must be sweated away.&rdquo;
&ldquo;You are a blockhead!&rdquo; cries a third, furiously striking at him with
his professional cane. &ldquo;I say it is a nervous affection of the cutis,
and the patient must immediately lose eighteen ounces of blood,
and then take a powerful drastic.&rdquo; &ldquo;What are you quarrelling
about?&rdquo; asks a fourth, arresting the downfall of his professional
brother&rsquo;s cane. &ldquo;You are all wrong! I say it is an inflammation
in the os sacrum, and therefore fourteen blisters must be immediately
applied to the part affected and the adjacents.&rdquo; The
table is down, and the prescriptions of the learned doctors covered
with the ink which flows from the ruined inkstand. The amused
patient (whom nature has meanwhile relieved of the cause and
effect) watches the combat from the adjoining bedroom, and
makes preparations to retreat and save both his &ldquo;pocket and his
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The year 1814 was marked by the bursting of one of the most
<span class="sn">1814.</span>
extraordinary religious bubbles with which England has ever been
scandalized. The person identified with and responsible for the
craze to which we allude, was Joanna Southcott, the daughter of
<span class="sn">Joanna Southcott.</span>
a farmer residing at the village of Gettisham, in Devonshire, where
she herself was born in the month of April, 1750. At the time,
therefore, the imposture was made patent to such of her deluded
followers as retained any remnants of the small stock of common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>37</span>
sense with which nature had originally endowed them, Joanna
was sixty-four years of age.</p>

<p>The village girl appears to have been a constant reader of the
Scriptures, which she studied with so much enthusiasm, that a
strong religious bias was established, which took almost entire
possession of her mind. Still, no marked peculiarity was manifested
until after she had attained forty years of age, at which time we
find her employed as a workwoman at an upholsterer&rsquo;s shop at
Exeter. The proprietor being a Methodist, the shop was visited
by ministers of that persuasion, and Joanna, with her &ldquo;serious
turn of mind,&rdquo; was not only permitted to join in their discussions,
but was regarded by these harmless folk somewhat in the light of
a prodigy. To a mind predisposed to religious mania (for it
would be unjust to stigmatize Joanna altogether as a wilful impostor)
the result was peculiarly unfortunate; she was visited
with dreams, which she quickly accepted as spiritual manifestations,
instead of being, as they really were, indications of a disordered
digestion.</p>

<p>Two years afterwards Joanna retired from secular business, and
set up as a prophetess at Exeter. She declared herself to be the
woman spoken of as &ldquo;the bride,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Lamb&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; the &ldquo;woman
clothed with the sun.&rdquo; The county lunatic asylum might have
done good at this point; but its wholesome discipline, unfortunately,
was not resorted to. She published in 1801 her first
inspired book, &ldquo;The Strange Effects of Faith,&rdquo; which absolutely
brought five &ldquo;wise men of Gotham&rdquo; to inquire into her pretensions
from different parts of England. Three of these learned
pundits were Methodist parsons, and these three parsons declared
themselves satisfied that the mission of Joanna was a divine one.
It is needless to add that in England, no matter how absurd the
nature of a so-called divine mission, it is safe and certain to attract
believers; and by the year 1803 the doctrines of Joanna
Southcott were eagerly swallowed by numerous simpletons in
various parts of the country.</p>

<p>Thus fortified, Joanna issued a manifesto, in which she stated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>38</span>
her calling and pretensions: we set it out in all the original
baldness of its composition:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, Joanna Southcott, am clearly convinced that my calling is
of God, and my writings are indited by His Spirit, as it is impossible
for any spirit but an all-wise God, that is wondrous in
working, wondrous in wisdom, wondrous in power, wondrous in
truth, could have brought round such mysteries, so full of truth,
as is in my writings; so I am clear in whom I have believed, that
all my writings came from the spirit of the most high God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joanna was clear in whom she believed, and her followers were
equally &ldquo;clear&rdquo; in their belief in Joanna. This incoherent nonsense
was signed in the presence of fifty-eight simpletons, all of
whom expressed their confidence in the inspired mission of their
precious prophetess.</p>

<p>Her disciples rapidly increased, and she visited in her apostolic
character, Bristol, Leeds, Stockport, and other large centres, obtaining
numerous converts everywhere. Among them was the
celebrated engraver, William Sharp; and to the last this man, who
out of his calling was the veriest simpleton living, and who had
swallowed successively the doctrines of Richard Brothers, Wright,
Bryan, and Joanna, believed in the divine mission of this unincarcerated
lunatic.</p>

<p>Although Joanna did not (like Joseph Smith) discover a book,
she discovered a seal, which one of her disciples is said to have
picked up in a dust-heap at Clerkenwell. With this miraculously
acquired talisman the spirit ordered her to &ldquo;seal up the people,&rdquo;
and as &ldquo;the people&rdquo; were limited to one hundred and forty-four
thousand, and each of the elect had to pay a sum varying at
different times from a guinea to twelve shillings, or even lower,
for the privilege of being &ldquo;sealed up,&rdquo; the scheme promised at
first to turn out a comfortably profitable one. Into the details
of the &ldquo;sealing&rdquo; it is unnecessary for us to enter. Suffice it to
say that the numbers of the &ldquo;sealed,&rdquo; up to 1808, when for
some unexplained reason the process appears to have been discontinued,
exceeded six thousand simpletons; the numbers of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>39</span>
her deluded followers in the metropolis and its vicinity alone, are
supposed at one time to have amounted to a hundred thousand.</p>

<p>Joanna was a coarse, common-place, and somewhat corpulent
woman; she dressed in a plain, quaker-like garb, in a gown of
Calimancoe, with a shawl and bonnet of drab colour. The three
leading preachers in her chapel in Southwark (her great stronghold),
were a Mr. Carpenter, who, after learning his business, set
up as a prophet on his own account; a Mr. Foley, and a lath-render
named Tozer. She had chapels also in Spitalfields, Greenwich,
Twickenham, and Gravesend.</p>

<p>The scribblings in prose and verse of this illiterate creature,
instead of being committed to the waste paper basket, were
solemnly preserved and received as prophecies. Attacked at last
with dropsy, her delusions assumed the following objectionable
form: she prophesied, and Sharp and his fellow-disciples&mdash;some
of whom were men of fair education&mdash;actually believed, that Christ
was to be born again under the name of &ldquo;Shiloh,&rdquo; and that
she, Joanna, at the age of sixty-five, was to be the mother.
The revelation which proclaimed the miraculous <i>accouchement</i> was
worded as follows: &ldquo;This year [1814], in the sixty-fifth year of
thy age, thou shalt have a son by the power of the Most High;
which if they (the Hebrews) receive as their prophet, priest, and
king, then I will restore them to their own land, and cast out
the heathen for their sakes, as I cast out them when they cast
out Me, by rejecting Me as their Saviour, Prince, and King,
for which I said I was born, but not at that time to establish
My kingdom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One might have imagined that this gibberish would open the
eyes of some at least of her votaries: their insane enthusiasm, on
the contrary, increased. Joanna was absolutely inundated with the
&ldquo;freewill&rdquo; offerings of the faithful&mdash;a costly cradle, white robes,
pinafores, shoes of satin and worsted, flannel shirts, napkins,
blankets, silver spoons, pap-boats, mugs, silver tea-pots, sugar-basins,
tongs, and corals,&mdash;absolutely without number. The absurdity
of the simpletons who sent these offerings was severely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>40</span>
criticised, both in England and on the Continent; and by way
apparently of answering her traducers, Joanna inserted an apostolical
advertisement in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> of Thursday, 22nd September,
1814, and in the <i>Courier</i> of Friday, 23rd, in which she
stated that, in consequence of the false and malicious reports in
circulation respecting herself, she was desirous of treating for
&ldquo;a spacious and ready-furnished house to be hired for three months,
in which her <i>accouchement</i> may take place in the presence of such
competent witnesses as shall be appointed by proper authority
to prove her character to the world.&rdquo; The appointed day&mdash;the
29th of October&mdash;however passed by, and the prophecy remained
of course unfulfilled, although, in the manufacturing towns of the
north, crowds of the faithful assembled to wait the arrival of
the coaches, in expectation of tidings of the great manifestation.
The satire entitled, <i>Delivering a Prophetess</i> (in vol. 8 of &ldquo;The
Scourge&rdquo;), has reference to the actual event which occurred on
the 27th of December, 1814, when death relieved Joanna of her
delusions and her dropsy; the wretched creature declaring on her
deathbed that, &ldquo;if she had been deceived, she had at all events
been the sport of some spirit, good or evil.&rdquo; Joanna forms the
subject of one of Rowlandson&rsquo;s caricatures of 1814, <i>Joanna Southcott,
the Prophetess, Excommunicating the Bishops</i>, published by Tegg
on the 20th of September, 1814. We shall also have to refer to her
again when we treat of the caricatures of George Cruikshank.</p>

<p>This year (1814) the Princess Charlotte, heiress presumptive
<span class="sn">Flight of the Princess Charlotte.</span>
actually ran away in a hackney coach, to avoid being affianced to
the Prince of Orange, to whom Her Royal Highness evinced an
invincible repugnance. The event is referred to in a caricature
entitled, <i>Plebeian Spirit, or Coachee and the Heiress Presumptive</i>
(published by Fores on the 25th of July), which shows us the
princess emerging from Warwick House, followed by Britannia (who
raises her hands in a suppliant attitude), and the dejected British
lion. &ldquo;Coachman, will you protect me?&rdquo; she appeals to the driver.
&ldquo;Yes, yes, your Highness,&rdquo; replies the fellow, &ldquo;to the last drop
of my blood!&rdquo; A servant in the royal livery holds up his hands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>41</span>
in amazement and horror, while another spurs off in hot haste
to apprise the Regent of the flight of his daughter. But a satire
of far superior merit, entitled, <i>Miss endeavouring to excite a glow
with her Dutch Plaything</i>,<a name="FnAnchor_20" href="#Footnote_20"><span class="sp">20</span></a> was issued by the same publisher a few
days previously, in which the rejected prince figures as a Dutch
top, which the princess has kept spinning for some time. &ldquo;There,&rdquo;
she says to her father at last, &ldquo;I have kept it up for a long while;
you may send it away now, I am tired of it; mother [<i>i.e.</i> the
Princess Caroline] has got some better plaything for me.&rdquo; &ldquo;What!
are you tired already?&rdquo; exclaims the Regent. &ldquo;Take another spell
at it, or give me the whip.&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replies Her Royal Highness;
&ldquo;you may take the top, but I&rsquo;ll keep the whip.&rdquo; Behind her is
a picture representing an orange falling with Cupid headlong into
space. The Regent was so incensed at his daughter&rsquo;s refractoriness,
that he went at once to Warwick House and dismissed all her
attendants, and never forgave the Duke of Sussex for his supposed
share in breaking off the connection. It was immediately after this
event that her mother, the Princess Caroline, contrary to the advice
of her friends and well-wishers, applied for permission to make that
tour on the Continent which, owing to her own obstinate folly and
contempt for the duties of her high station, was destined&mdash;as we shall
afterwards find&mdash;to end in such disastrous consequences to herself.</p>

<p>In the course of the year 1812, England had become involved&mdash;scarcely
<span class="sn">1812 1815.</span>
through any fault of her own&mdash;in a war with the United
States of America. The causes of difference were mainly due to
the obnoxious Orders in Council, which had been <i>forced</i> upon us
in consequence of the Berlin and Milan Decrees of Napoleon. As
an evidence, however, of our own friendly intentions, it may be
mentioned that the Regent had issued a declaration on the 23rd
of April, that if at any time the obnoxious decrees should by <i>an
authentic act be absolutely</i> repealed, thenceforth the Orders in Council
of 7th January, 1807, and 26th April, 1809, should be revoked;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>42</span>
<span class="sn">America and England.</span>
and the American representative, having, on the 20th of May, transmitted
to the English Court a copy of a French decree of the 20th
of April, by which the decrees of Milan and Berlin were declared
to be no longer in force, <i>so far as American vessels were concerned</i>, the
Regent declared that, although he could not accept the terms of
the decree as satisfying the conditions of his own declaration of the
23rd of April, yet, with the view of re-establishing friendly relations,
<i>he revoked</i> the Orders in Council of 7th January, 1807, and April
26th, 1809, so far as regarded American vessels and American
cargoes. Of this repeal, be it observed, the United States Government
took no notice, it might be in consequence of the very reasonable
proviso annexed to the Regent&rsquo;s concession, that unless the Government
of the United States revoked their exclusion of British armed
vessels from their harbours, while those of France were admitted,
and their interdiction of British commerce, while that of France was
allowed, the order was to be of no effect.</p>

<p>A very old English proverb tells us that &ldquo;a stick is never wanting
to beat a dog;&rdquo; and where one nation wishes to fasten a quarrel on
another, and the opportunity be favourable, there will be no difficulty
in finding an excuse. There were other causes of discontent; in
particular our claim to search not only for English goods, but for
British seamen serving on board neutral vessels; and as the sovereignty
of the seas depended on upholding these assumptions, our
Government was as strenuous in enforcing them as the French
emperor was bent on the maintenance of his continental system.</p>

<p>The Americans, however, were anxious for a war with this country,
and in particular, the opportunity seemed eminently favourable for
attempting the conquest of Canada. A motion in the House of
Representatives, for the indefinite postponement of a bill for raising
25,000 additional troops, was rejected by a majority of 98 to 29.
An outrageous bill, specially intended as an insult to England, was
introduced into the same House about the end of April, &ldquo;for the
protection, recovery, and indemnification of American seamen,&rdquo;
the first clause of which declared that every person who, under
pretence of a commission from a foreign power, should impress upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>43</span>
<span class="sn">Hostile Spirit of the Americans.</span>
the high seas a native seaman of the United States, should be
adjudged a pirate and a felon, and should upon conviction suffer
death. Another of its articles gave to every such seaman impressed
under the British flag, the right of attaching in the hands of any
British subject, or in the hands of <i>any debtor of any British subject</i>,
a sum equal to thirty dollars per month for the whole time of his
detention. This monstrous bill was actually allowed to pass a
third reading. The temper of the Americans may be judged by
the result of the voting on Mr. Randolph&rsquo;s motion in the same
House, on the 29th of May. That gentleman submitted &ldquo;that,
under the present circumstances, it was inexpedient to resort to
a war with Great Britain.&rdquo; The question being then put, that the
House do proceed to the consideration of the said resolution, it
was negatived by 62 votes against 37. Under the overpowering
influence of these feelings, war was declared against England on
the 18th of June, 1812; our own declaration was not issued until
the 13th of October following.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our American cousins,&rdquo; did not wait for this joinder of issue;
they had invaded Canada early in July. On the 11th of that month,
the American General Hull, with a body of 2,500 men&mdash;regulars
and militia&mdash;crossed the river above Detroit with most disastrous
consequences to himself. He was speedily forced to retreat, and
on the 16th of August to surrender the important fort of Detroit
itself, with his 2,500 men and thirty-three pieces of artillery.
Although this disaster seriously disconcerted the American plans
of invasion, the design was by no means abandoned. A considerable
force was assembled in the neighbourhood of Niagara, and on
the 13th of October, the American General Wadsworth, with some
1,400 men, made an attack on the British position of Queenstown,
on the Niagara river. Wadsworth, with 900 men and many officers,
was speedily compelled to surrender to British forces not exceeding
the number of his own following.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the losses of the Americans on land were
to some extent balanced by their naval successes. On the 19th
of August, the English frigate <i>Guerriere</i>, Captain Dacres, was forced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>44</span>
<span class="sn">American Naval Successes.</span>
after a gallant but (as we shall see) unequal fight, to strike her colours
to the American frigate <i>Constitution</i>, Captain Hull. Under similar
conditions, the English frigate <i>Macedonia</i>, Captain Carden, was
forced on the 25th of October, after an hour&rsquo;s hard fighting, in
which the English lost 104 men killed and wounded, to yield to
the American frigate <i>United States</i>, Commodore Decatur. These
successes were due to the following causes: the rate of the American
frigates corresponded to the largest British; but in size, weight of
metal, and number of men, were almost equal to line-of-battle
ships; the American navy too, at this time, was manned by sailors
many of whom were unfortunately British tars, while many more
had been trained in British service.</p>

<p>Although we do not profess to give a history of the Anglo-American
war of 1812-14, some slight sketch of its more remarkable
incidents seems necessary for the purpose of enabling the
reader to understand what has to follow. Having named some of
the American naval successes, we can scarcely pass over the well-known
fight of the 1st of June, 1813. Captain Broke, of the British
frigate <i>Shannon</i>, 330 men, burning with indignation at the naval
defeats of his countrymen, having diligently perfected his crew in
discipline, offered battle to the United States frigate <i>Chesapeake</i>,
for which he had long been watching. The <i>Chesapeake</i> was a fine
ship, carrying forty-nine guns (18- and 32-pounders) and a complement
of 440 men. The American captain, nothing loth, bore
down on his antagonist off Boston light-house. The ships were
soon in close contact; but the gallant English captain, discerning
his opportunity, gave orders for boarding, himself setting the
example; and after a sanguinary fight of only fifteen minutes, hauled
down his adversary&rsquo;s flag and carried off the <i>Chesapeake</i> in triumph.
The invasion of Canada was still persevered in by the Americans,
with varying successes and defeats; but the results of the campaign
of 1813 were in the end disastrous to them; and by the 12th of
December, both provinces of Canada were freed from the invaders,
who retired to winter quarters within their own territory. Another
determined attempt to penetrate into Canada was made by them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>45</span>
<span class="sn">The English Assume the Offensive.</span>
in July, 1814, the British troops in the first instance being obliged
to fall back: this was on the 5th. Their triumph, however, was of
brief duration. Veteran troops, who had served under Wellington
in Spain, had meanwhile arrived at Quebec; General Drummond
arrested the further retreat of Riall&rsquo;s division, and a decisive battle
ensued, which terminated in the defeat of the Americans, who were
obliged to retire with precipitation beyond the Chippewa. On the
following day they abandoned their camp, threw the greater part
of their baggage and provisions into the rapids, and after destroying
the bridge over the Chippewa, continued their retreat in great
disorder to Fort Erie. Out of a force of 5,000 men, they had lost
in killed, wounded, and prisoners at least 1,500. This defeat, and
the timely arrival of veteran troops from Europe, appear to have
decided the British commanders to change the defensive warfare
they had hitherto adopted, and the small operations they had
conducted on the coast of the southern States, for offensive movements
of greater vigour.</p>

<p>A large naval force was despatched under the command of Vice-Admiral
Cockrane, having on board a powerful land force commanded
by General Ross. The latter landed on the 20th of
August at Benedict; marched to Nottingham on the 21st, and to
Upper Marlborough on the 22nd, Admiral Cockrane in the meanwhile,
with the barges, armed launches, and other boats of the
fleet, having the marines on board, proceeding up the Patuxent on
the flank of the army. The American Commodore blew up his
vessels, seventeen in number, with the exception of one which fell
into the hands of the British. The troops reached Bladensburg
(about five miles from Washington) on the 24th.</p>

<p>About 9,400 Americans (400 of whom were cavalry) drawn up to
oppose them, were speedily routed, with the loss of ten pieces of
artillery and the capture of their commanding officer, General Barney.
It appears to have been General Ross&rsquo;s first intention to return to his
ships after laying the capital under contribution; but the Americans
having fired upon the bearer of the flag of truce who was sent
forward with the conditions, all thoughts of an arrangement were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>46</span>
<span class="sn">Burning of Washington.</span>
dissipated. The soldiers pressed into the city, and after burning
a frigate and sloop of war, the President&rsquo;s residence, the capitol&mdash;including
the Senate House and House of Representatives, dockyard,
arsenal, war office, treasury, and the great bridge over the
Potomac, re-embarked on the 30th of August.</p>

<p>A part of the operations against Washington consisted in despatching
a force against Fort Washington, situate on the Potomac
below that city. Captain Gordon, the commander of this expedition,
proceeded with the <i>Sea Horse</i> and several other vessels up the
river on the 17th of August, but was unable to reach the fort till
the 27th. The place being rendered untenable by the explosion
of a powder magazine, the garrison spiked their guns and evacuated
it next day. The populous and commercial town of Alexandria,
situated higher on the river, thus lost its sole protection; and
Captain Gordon, having no obstacle to oppose his progress, buoyed
the channel, and placed his ships in such a position as to enforce
compliance with his terms. The town (with the exception of public
works) was not to be destroyed nor the inhabitants molested on
compliance with the following articles:&mdash;All naval and ordnance
stores, public and private, were to be given up, together with all the
shipping, the furniture of which was to be sent on board by their
owners; the sunk vessels to be delivered in their original condition;
the merchandise of every description to be immediately delivered
up, including all removed from the town since the 19th; and the
British squadron to be supplied with refreshments at the market
price. This capitulation was signed on the 29th; the whole of the
captured vessels&mdash;twenty-one in number&mdash;were fitted, loaded, and
delivered, by the 31st; and Captain Gordon had got back with
all his ships and prizes, and anchored in safety in the Chesapeake
by the 9th of September.</p>

<p>These events are referred to in a pictorial satire (published by
Fores on the 4th of October, 1814), entitled, <i>The Fall of Washington,

<p>James Madison and one of his ministers, habited as Quakers
<span class="sn">Flight of President Madison.</span>
(a then popular mode of ridiculing the Americans), are seen in full
flight, carrying under their arms bundles of compromising papers.
By the &ldquo;Bill of fare of the Cabinet Supper at President Madison&rsquo;s,
August 24th, 1814,&rdquo; which has fallen at his feet, the flight would
really seem to have been of the most hasty character. &ldquo;I say,
Jack,&rdquo; says an English tar, pointing at the same time to the flying
President, &ldquo;what, is <i>that</i> the man of war that was to annihilate us,
as Master Boney used to say?&rdquo; &ldquo;Aye, messmate,&rdquo; answers his companion;
&ldquo;he is a famous fighter over a bottle of Shampain; why, he&rsquo;d
have played &mdash;&mdash; with us if we had let him sit down to supper.&rdquo; Five
Americans (all Quakers) meanwhile make their own observations
on the situation: &ldquo;Jonathan,&rdquo; says one, &ldquo;where thinkest thou our
President will run to now?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, verily,&rdquo; answers Jonathan, &ldquo;to
Elba, to his bosom friend.&rdquo; &ldquo;The great Washington,&rdquo; remarks a
third, &ldquo;fought for liberty; but we are fighting for shadows, which,
if obtained, could do us no earthly good, but this is the blessed effects
of it.&rdquo; &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; observes a fourth, &ldquo;this is what Maddis calls
benefitting his country.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; answers his friend, &ldquo;it will throw
such a light on affairs, that we shall find it necessary to change both
men and measures.&rdquo; The popular notion of the day that there had
been some understanding between &ldquo;Boney&rdquo; and the Yankees, was
scarcely unnatural under the circumstances we have narrated. The
President himself is made to say to his companion, &ldquo;Who would
have thought of this man, to oblige us to run from the best cabinet
supper I ever ordered? I hope you have taken care of Boney&rsquo;s
promissory notes; the people won&rsquo;t stand anything after this.&rdquo;
&ldquo;D&mdash;n his notes,&rdquo; answers the other; &ldquo;what are they good for
now? We should get nothing but iron; he hasn&rsquo;t any of his
stock of brass left, or some of <i>that</i> would have helped us through
this business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The caricaturist simply reflected the opinion of his countrymen in
insinuating that the Yankees had some understanding or sympathy
with Bonaparte; but in this they were mistaken. With Napoleon
and his system the Americans had no sympathy or feelings in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>48</span>
common. Probably all that the satirist intended to convey was the
fact that they had brought the retaliatory measure (severe as it was)
upon themselves, and in this undoubtedly he was right. The
Americans would never have dreamed of invading Canada had they
not supposed that we were so hampered with our struggle with
Bonaparte in 1812. It was perhaps well for America that we were
not actuated by the same embittered feelings as themselves; that our
generals were incompetent, and their plans both badly conceived and
most inefficiently carried out.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these successes, the caricaturists proved a trifle
<span class="sn">The Caricaturists too Jubilant.</span>
too jubilant. On the 11th of September, a British naval force&mdash;consisting
of a frigate, a brig, two sloops of war, and some gunboats&mdash;attacked
the American flotilla before Platsburg, on Lake Champlain,
and after a severe conflict were all captured, with the exception
of the gun-boats, Captain Downie, the English commander,
being killed at the very beginning of the engagement. Sir G.
Prevost, in consequence of this disaster, began his retreat, leaving
his sick and wounded to the mercy of the enemy. The Americans
having now collected from all quarters, the British retired to their
lines, and relinquished all idea of penetrating into the State of New
York. On the 12th, however, an attempt was made to enter Baltimore,
and although in the engagement which followed the American
troops were broken and dispersed in the course of fifteen minutes,
the victory was dearly purchased by the death of General Ross,
while the defensive arrangements of the harbour were so perfect and
so formidable, that the attempt was obliged to be given up.</p>

<p>Although peace was concluded in the following December, the
intelligence unfortunately did not reach the belligerents in time to
prevent further mistakes and bloodshed. A series of operations of
the British army in the neighbourhood of New Orleans occupied
the last week of December and a part of January. An army had
been collected for an attack on that town under the command of
General Kean, which, with the assistance of Admiral Cochrane, was
disembarked without resistance on the 23rd December. On the
25th, General Sir Edward Pakenham arrived and assumed the chief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>49</span>
command. On the 27th, the enemy&rsquo;s picquets were driven in
within six miles of the town, where their main body was found most
strongly posted, and supported by a ship of war moored in such a
position as to enfilade the assailants. The result was that the
assault of the British was delivered under so withering a fire from
every part of the enemy&rsquo;s line, that General Pakenham was killed,
Generals Keane and Gibbs wounded, while over 2,000 men and
officers were killed, wounded, or made prisoners. Colonel Thornton,
indeed, had crossed the river during the previous night and captured
a flanking battery of the Americans on the other side; but the report
made by him to General Lambert was of so discouraging a character
that he decided not to persevere with the attempt, and in the end
the whole army re-embarked, leaving a few of the most dangerously
wounded behind them, but carrying off all their artillery, ammunition,
and stores. The concluding operation of the war was the capture
of Fort Mobile, which surrendered to the British on the 11th of
February.</p>

<p>A remarkable figure puts in an appearance in the caricatures of
<span class="sn">1815.<br />Romeo Coates.</span>
the early part of the century. This was the renowned &ldquo;Romeo&rdquo;
Coates, a vain, weak-minded gentleman, who had an absolute passion
for figuring on the boards as Romeo, Lothario, Belcour, and other
romantic characters, for which his personal appearance and lack of
brains altogether unfitted him. His &ldquo;readings,&rdquo; like himself,
being of the most original character, his vagaries afforded endless
amusement to the coarse public of his day. The gods befooled him
&ldquo;to the top of his bent;&rdquo; his overweening vanity failing to show
the poor creature that he was exciting ridicule instead of applause.
The fun (?) culminated in the tragic scene, Romeo, to their delight,
responding to the encores of his audience, by repeating the dying
scene so long as it suited the managers to prolong the sorry exhibition.
Macready, whose dramatic genius and refined sensibilities
revolted at a spectacle so degrading, describes him as he appeared
at Bath, in 1815: &ldquo;I was at the theatre,&rdquo; says the tragedian, &ldquo;on
the morning of his rehearsal, and introduced to him. At night the
house was too crowded to afford me a place in front, and seeing me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>50</span>
behind the scenes, he asked me, knowing I acted Belcour, to prompt
him if he should be &lsquo;out,&rsquo; which he very much feared. The
audience were in convulsions at his absurdities, and in the scene with
Miss Rusport, being really &lsquo;out,&rsquo; I gave him a line which Belcour
has to speak, &lsquo;I never looked so like a fool in all my life,&rsquo; which, as
he delivered it, was greeted with a roar of laughter. He was &lsquo;out&rsquo;
again, and I gave him again the same line, which, again being
repeated, was acquiesced in with a louder roar. Being &lsquo;out&rsquo; again,
I administered him the third time the same truth for him to utter,
but he seemed alive to its application, rejoining in some dudgeon,
&rsquo;I have said that twice already.&rsquo; His exhibition was a complete
burlesque of the comedy and a reflection on the character of a
management that could profit by such discreditable expedients.&rdquo;
Poor &ldquo;Romeo&rdquo; Coates lived to get over his theatrical weakness, and
died (in 1848), in his seventy-sixth year, from the results of a street
accident.</p>

<p>The Princess Charlotte of Wales, having successfully thrown over
<span class="sn">1816.<br />Marriage of the Princess Charlotte.</span>
her royal Dutch suitor, was married at Carlton House to Prince
Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, afterwards King of the Belgians, on the
2nd of May, 1816. Prior to the marriage, Parliament had voted
a provision for an establishment for the pair of £60,000, while in the
event of the princess&rsquo;s death, £50,000 was settled on the prince
during his life. <i>Leap Year, or John Bull&rsquo;s Establishment</i> (S. W.
Fores, March, 1816) shows us John Bull with a bit in his mouth,
driven by Her Royal Highness, who lashes him unmercifully with a
tremendous horse-whip. Miserable John is saddled with a pair of
panniers, one of which carries the prince and his money bags, the
other being filled with heavy packages labelled with different impositions
or items of expenditure of which John is the victim. &ldquo;Plans
for thatched cottages,&rdquo; &ldquo;Plan for pulling down and rebuilding,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Assessed taxes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Increase of salaries,&rdquo; &ldquo;Army for peace establishment,&rdquo;
and so on. Says Leopold to the princess, &ldquo;You drive so
fast, I shall be off!!!&rdquo; &ldquo;Never fear,&rdquo; she replies; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you
an English waltz.&rdquo; The gouty Regent hobbles after them on his
crutches, the supports of which are formed of dragons from his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>51</span>
famous Brighton Pavilion. &ldquo;Push on!&rdquo; he shouts to his daughter
and future son-in-law, &ldquo;Push on! Preach economy! and when you
have got your money, follow my example.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh! my back,&rdquo; groans
poor John, crawling with the greatest difficulty under the weight of
his heavy burdens. &ldquo;I never can bear it! This will finish me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two years which succeeded the fall of Bonaparte were remarkable
for the distress which prevailed amongst the industrial
classes in England. The glory we had reaped in our long struggle
with France was forgotten in the consideration of the almost insupportable
burdens which it necessarily entailed. The sufferings
<span class="sn">Popular Discontent.</span>
of the masses prompted them to seek relief by bringing their
grievances before Parliament; but the reception their petitions met
with, served only to show the little sympathy which existed between
the national representatives, as then elected, and the people of England.
Petitions were next presented to the Regent himself, while
the popular discontent found expression in large meetings convened
in London, Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham, and other industrial
centres. These meetings, it was observed, were convened, attended,
and addressed almost exclusively by the working classes, the middle
and upper ranks taking no share in the proceedings. The speakers
pointed out in impressive and forcible language the various evils
which they said had brought about their altered condition; the
waste of public money in perpetual wars, in unearned pensions,
sinecures, and other unjust expenditure. The high price of provisions
provoked riots at Brandon, Norwich, Newcastle, Ely,
Glasgow, Preston, Leicester, Merthyr, Tredegar, and other places;
a large number of the populace assembled in Spafields in December
to receive the Regent&rsquo;s answer to their petition. While waiting the
arrival of &ldquo;orator&rdquo; Hunt, one of the most popular of the agitators
of the day, a band of desperadoes appeared on the scene with
a tri-coloured flag, and headed by a man named Watson, who,
after delivering a violent harangue from a waggon, led them into
the city. The rioters pillaged several gunsmiths&rsquo; shops, but the
prompt action of Lord Mayor Wood, the strong party of constables
at his back, who seized several of the rioters, and the appearance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>52</span>
on the scene of the military, soon induced the rioters to disperse.
In January, 1817, John Cashman, one of the Spafields rioters, was
tried for burglariously entering the shop of Mr. Beckworth, a gunsmith,
and hanged opposite the scene of his depredations.</p>

<p>The Regent opened Parliament on the 28th of January, 1817.
<span class="sn">1817.<br />Regent opens Parliament.</span>
In his address, he said that &ldquo;the distress consequent upon the
termination of a war of such universal extent and duration, had
been felt with greater or less severity throughout all the nations
of Europe, and had been considerably aggravated by the unfavourable
state of the season.&rdquo; Alluding to the proceedings of the popular
agitators, he added: &ldquo;In considering our internal situation, you
will, I doubt not, feel a just indignation at the attempts which
have been made to take advantage of the distresses of the country,
for the purpose of exciting a spirit of sedition and violence....
I am determined to omit no precautions for preserving the public
peace, and for counteracting the designs of the disaffected.&rdquo;
Whether this statement was the cause or not, the Regent had
a narrow escape on his return from the House; for, while passing
at the back of the gardens of Carlton House, the glass of his
window was broken, either by a stone or (as was supposed) by two
balls from an air-gun, which appeared to have been aimed at His
Royal Highness.</p>

<p>On the 6th of February, Lord Cockrane presented to the House
of Commons the petition of the Spafields meeting, signed by 24,000
persons. It prayed for annual parliaments, universal suffrage, and
reduction in the public expenditure. He presented at the same
time a petition from Manchester, signed by 30,000 persons, praying
for reform in Parliament and economy in the public expenditure.
Sir Francis Burdett also presented a Leeds petition for the same
objects, containing 7,000 signatures. These were of course only
legitimate modes of expressing the wants of the people; but, unhappily,
quite independent of the action of the popular leaders,
the country in some parts was so disturbed, so closely on the brink
of insurrection, that ministers found themselves obliged twice during
the course of the year to resort to the almost unprecedented measure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>53</span>
of suspending the Habeas Corpus Act, on the first occasion at the
end of February, and on the second in June.</p>

<p>At a meeting held at Manchester in March, for the purpose of
petitioning the Regent against the suspension of the Act, it was
proposed and agreed that another meeting should be held on the
following Monday (the 10th of March), with the professed intention
that ten out of every twenty persons who attended it should proceed
to London with a petition to His Royal Highness. The
meeting took place accordingly; many thousands actually attended
in full marching order (<i>i.e.</i> provided with a bundle and a blanket);
and a considerable body appear to have made some advance on
their way before their further progress was arrested. Expeditions
of a similar character were simultaneously planned, attempted, and
frustrated in other parts of the country.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there were trials for high treason at Westminster
<span class="sn">Government Spies.</span>
Hall; trials of rioters at York and Derby; and at the latter town,
on the 7th of November, three miserable men were hung. Among
the witnesses at these trials appear to have been two men named
Castle and Oliver: and it came out that these fellows, with two
other Government spies, named Edwards and Franklin, had been
among the chief fomenters by speeches and writings of the seditions
in the Metropolis and northern counties. The disclosures made
by these scoundrels produced of course a great sensation and
numerous satires. One of these, entitled, <i>More Plots!!! More
Plots!!!</i> published by Fores in August, 1817, is &ldquo;dedicated to
the inventors, Lord S [idmouth] and Lord C [astlereagh].&rdquo; It is
divided into four compartments. In the first we see four foxes
(typifying no doubt the four informers) watching the movements of
a flock of geese. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis plain,&rdquo; says one of the former, &ldquo;there
is a plot on foot; let&rsquo;s seize them, Brother Oliver.&rdquo; &ldquo;I have no
doubt of it: I can smell it plainly,&rdquo; answers his companion. In
the second, a couple of fierce nondescript beasts are regarding
a number of innocent lambs: &ldquo;These bloodthirsty wretches,&rdquo;
remarks one of the two, &ldquo;mean to destroy man, woman, and
child, I know it to a certainty; for they carry sedition, privy conspiracy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>54</span>
and rebellion in their looks.&rdquo; &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll swear it, Brother
Castle,&rdquo; says his companion; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s dash at them.&rdquo; In the third,
a cat watches the movements of some unsuspecting mice: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a pretty collection of rogues gathered together,&rdquo; observes Grimalkin;
&ldquo;if there is not a plot among them, burn my tail and whiskers.&rdquo; In the
last, we behold a Kite just about to pounce on some chicken: &ldquo;The
world&rsquo;s over-run with iniquity,&rdquo; says the bird of prey; &ldquo;and these
troublesome miscreants will not let honest hawks sleep in security.&rdquo;
We shall return to the subject of these Government spies and
the troubles of 1817 in the graphic satires of George Cruikshank.</p>

<p>In 1817, the rivalry between the two national theatres ran so
<span class="sn">Edmund Kean and Booth.</span>
high, that the Covent Garden management employed agents to
scour the provinces in search of a rival to Edmund Kean at Drury
Lane. After a time one was found in the person of Lucius Junius
Booth, who in stature, <i>rôle</i> of characters, and (as it was imagined)
style of acting, closely resembled, if he did not equal, the great
original. He made his <i>début</i> at Covent Garden, in the character
of Richard the Third.  Whether it was a success or not seems
doubtful; for the manager being out of town, those deputed to
act as deputies did not care to undertake the responsibility of
engaging the new star. In this dilemma, overtures were made
to him by the rival house, which he accepted, and made his
appearance as &ldquo;Iago&rdquo; to Kean&rsquo;s &ldquo;Othello&rdquo; to a densely-packed
audience at Drury Lane. So great was the likeness between the
two actors, that strangers were puzzled to know which was Kean
and which was Booth, until the tragedy reached the third act, when
the genius of Kean made itself felt, and no doubt remained in the
minds of the audience which was master of his art.</p>

<p>Booth, in fact, discovered that he had made a mistake, and the
day after his trial at old Drury, signed articles to return to Covent
Garden for three years. Here he proved a great attraction; he
must have been in truth an actor of no ordinary merit; his rendering
of the character of Lear, in particular, met with universal approbation,
and in this tragedy he was supported by actors of the ability of
Charles Kemble and William Macready, both of whom he threw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>55</span>
into the shade. At the end, however, of his engagement, feeling
that he was incapable of meeting Kean on anything like equal terms,
he set sail for America.</p>

<p>The appearance of Edmund Kean and Lucius Junius Booth at
Drury Lane is referred to in a satire entitled, <i>The Rival Richards</i>,
published by S. W. Fores in 1817. The sketch (evidently the
work of an amateur) shows us Folly seated on an ass, holding in
one hand a pair of scales, in one of which stands Booth, and in the
other Edmund Kean. To the mind of the satirist there appears to
be no difference in the abilities of the two performers, as the scales
exactly balance. On the right, the portico of Covent Garden is
overshadowed by the inelegant but massive proportions of Drury
Lane; the intervening space being occupied by various figures and
details, among which is a &ldquo;patent clapping machine.&rdquo; An advertisement
board carried by one of the figures clearly shows that the
satire&mdash;an elaborate idea badly worked out&mdash;has reference to the
period when both actors were engaged at &ldquo;old Drury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the most important event of the year 1818 was the
<span class="sn">1818.<br />Evacuation of France.</span>
congress of the allied sovereigns at Aix-la-Chapelle, and the evacuation
of France which followed. By the second treaty of Paris, the
stay of the occupying armies had been fixed at a period of five
years; but by an official note, dated the 4th of November, 1818,
the ministers of Austria, Great Britain, Russia, and Prussia, referring
to the engagements entered into by the French Government
with the subscribing powers to that treaty, stated that such
Government had fulfilled all the clauses of the treaty, and proposed,
&ldquo;with respect to those clauses, the fulfilment of which was reserved
for more remote periods, arrangements which were satisfactory&rdquo; to
the contracting parties. Under these circumstances the sovereigns
resolved that the military occupation of France should forthwith be
discontinued.</p>

<p>On the 7th of November, the Duke of Wellington, commander-in-chief
of the army of occupation, issued an order of the day, taking
leave of the troops under his command, which concluded in the
following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>56</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is with regret that the general has seen the moment arrive
when the dissolution of this army was to put an end to his public
connections and his private relations with the commanders and
other officers of the corps of the army. The field marshal deeply
feels how agreeable these relations have been to him. He begs the
generals commanding in chief to receive and make known to the
troops under their orders, the assurance that he shall never cease to
take the most lively interest in everything that may concern them;
and that the remembrance of the three years during which he has
had the honour to be at their head, will be always dear to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Wellington appears to have received particular marks of distinction
from the Emperor Alexander; but what may have been the particular
tittle tattle which led up to the caricature we shall next
describe, we are now unable to fathom. That it grew out of the
event which we have attempted to describe will be sufficiently
obvious. It is entitled, <i>A Russian Dandy at Home; a scene at Aix-la-Chapelle</i>,
and was published by Fores in December, 1818. In it,
the satirist shows us the Duke arrayed in the regimentals of a
Russian general, part of which comprise a pair of jack-boots considerably
too large for him, a fact which amuses the Emperor and
certain English and Cossack officers at his back. The following
doggerel appended to the satire affords an explanation of its meaning:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>

<p>&ldquo;It is said that the head of the forces allied,</p>

<p>A well-drawn caricature, published by Fores in February, 1818,
<span class="sn">Queen Charlotte.</span>
and entitled, <i>A Peep at the Pump Room, or the Zomersetshire Folks
in a Maze</i>, shows us a singularly ugly old woman habited in a
wonderful bonnet, and clothes of antiquated make and fashion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>57</span>
drinking the Bath waters in the midst of a circle of deeply interested
and curious gazers. This poor old woman, who looks very like
an old nurse, is no less a person than Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz,
Queen of George the Third, who, in failing health and
rapidly drawing towards the close of her earthly pilgrimage, had
been recommended by her physicians to try the effect of the Bath
waters. The excitement which this event occasioned in the then
gay, but now decayed western city, is thus referred to by Mrs.
Piozzi in two of her contemporary letters to Sir James Fellowes:
&ldquo;The queen has driven us all distracted; such a bustle Bath never
witnessed before. She drinks at the Pump Room, purposes going
to say her prayers at the Abbey Church, and a box is making up for
her at the theatre.&rdquo; And again: &ldquo;Of the clusters in the Pump Room
who <i>swarm</i> round Queen Charlotte, as if she were actually the queen
bee, courtiers must give you an account.&rdquo; At the back of Her
Majesty&rsquo;s chair stands the portly figure of the Duke of Clarence,
who recommends the old lady to qualify the water (which is evidently
very distasteful to her) with a little brandy. &ldquo;George and
I,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;always recommend brandy.&rdquo; A fat, well favoured
woman in a flower-pot bonnet, with a gin bottle in her hand, on the
other hand recommends the old queen to qualify the Bath water
with a dash of &ldquo;Old Tom,&rdquo; advice which is seconded by the old
woman next her. Behind this last stands the physician, watch in
hand, watching, and moreover predicting in very plain terms, the
expected action of the medicated water. The folks behind make
their observations on the old lady&rsquo;s appearance. &ldquo;Well, I declare,&rdquo;
says one, &ldquo;I see nothing extraordinary to look at.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, she
doant look a bit better than oul granny,&rdquo; remarks a country joskin.
&ldquo;Who said she did, eh, dame?&rdquo; replies her companion. Poor old
Queen Charlotte was never a beauty, and those who remember her
exaggerated likenesses in the satires of Gillray, will not fail to
recognise her in the present satire. One of her well-known habits
is referred to by the snuff-box which lies at her feet.</p>

<p>The poor old lady was beyond the help of the Bath waters or of
any earthly assistance.  We find Mrs. Piozzi writing a few months
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>58</span>
later on: &ldquo;Nothing kills the queen, however. It is really a great
misfortune to be kept panting for breath so, and screaming with
pain by medical skill: were she a subject, I suppose they would
have released her long ago; but diseases and distresses of the
human frame must lead to death at length,&rdquo; which was the case with
the poor old queen, who died nine months after the date of the
satire (in November, 1818).</p>

<p>The announcement of the marriages of four of her children this
year, viz.: of the Princess Elizabeth to Frederick, Landgrave of
Hesse Homburg; of Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent, to Victoria,
daughter of the Duke of Saxe-Coburg (and mother of Queen Victoria),
on the 29th of May; of Adolphus Frederick, Duke of Cambridge, to
Augusta, daughter of the Landgrave of Hesse, on the 1st of May;
and of William Henry, Duke of Clarence (afterwards William the
Fourth), to Adelaide, daughter of the Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, on
the 11th of July, gave rise to a coarse though admirably executed
caricature entitled, <i>The Homburg Waltz, with Characteristic Sketches
of Family Dancing</i>, in which all these royal personages, with the
Regent at their head, are seen prominently figuring amongst the
dancers.</p>

<p>A forgotten but ingenious instrument, the kaleidoscope, was
<span class="sn">Invention of the Kaleidoscope.</span>
invented by Sir David Brewster in 1818. The leading principles
of the toy appear to have been accidentally discovered in the course
of a series of experiments on the polarization of light by successive
reflections between plates of glass. The invention of this now
despised toy made a tremendous sensation at the time, and the
inventor was induced to take out a patent for its protection; but he
had, it appears, divulged the secret of its construction before he
had secured the invention to himself, and the consequence was that,
although &ldquo;it made a hundred shopmen rich,&rdquo; it brought the inventor
himself but little substantial benefit. This is explained by the fact
that it was so simple in construction, that even when made without
scientific accuracy, it served to delight as well as to amuse. So
largely was it pirated, that it was calculated that no fewer than two
hundred thousand were sold in three months in London and Paris
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>59</span>
alone. Judging by a caricature of Williams&rsquo;s, published by Fores in
June, 1818, and its doggerel explanation, the toys would appear even
at this time to have been made and sold by every street boy. The
satire is called, <i>Caleidoscopes, or Paying for Peeping</i>. In it, we see the
pertinacious vendors pushing the sale of their wares upon the passengers
in the streets&mdash;many of them women. A bishop resolves to
buy one because the coloured glass reminds him of a painted window
in his cathedral, another person has paid dearly for &ldquo;peeping,&rdquo; and
discovers that while gratifying his curiosity, his &ldquo;pocket-book has
slipped off with two hundred pounds in it.&rdquo; Williams was a satirist
of the old school, and the allusions made by some of the vendors
render this otherwise interesting satire wantonly coarse and indelicate.
Attached to this rare and curious production is the following
doggerel:&mdash;</p>

<p>Another invention made its appearance in 1819: this was the
<span class="sn">1819.<br />The Hobby.</span>
<i>velocipede</i>, or as it was then called &ldquo;the hobby,&rdquo; the grandfather of
the bicycle and tricycle of our day. A tall gawky perched on the
summit of a lofty bicycle, with an enormous wheel gyrating between
a couple of spindle shanks capped with enormous crab-shells, is a
sufficiently familiar and ridiculous object in our times; but the
appearance presented by the people of 1819, who adopted the spider
looking thing called a &ldquo;hobby,&rdquo; was so intensely comical that it
gave rise to a perfect flood of caricatures. The best of these we
have personally met with is one entitled, <i>The Spirit Moving the
Quakers upon Worldly Vanities</i>, a skit upon the Society of Friends
(published by J. T. Sidebotham). The scene is laid in front of a
&ldquo;Society of Friends Meeting House,&rdquo; and numerous &ldquo;Friends&rdquo; of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>60</span>
both sexes are busily engaged in exercising their hobbies. In the
foreground, a broad-brimmed young &ldquo;Friend&rdquo; gives ardent and
amorous chase to a lovely Quakeress, who, apparently disinclined
to encourage his advances, urges her steed to its utmost speed, and
makes frantic endeavours to get out of his way.</p>

<p>The internal condition of the country this year (1819) gave cause
<span class="sn">Depression in Trade.</span>
for much anxiety. Pecuniary distress, owing to the depression in
trade, was almost universal. This state of things, as might have been
expected, was taken advantage of by the popular agitators for their
own purposes; and the people, under their encouragement, as in the
two previous years, continued to give audible expression to their
dissatisfaction at meetings, and through the medium of publications
more or less of a seditious character. The miserable outlook
gave rise (among others) to a pair of caricatures, published by Fores
on the 9th of January, <i>John Bull in Clover</i>, and (by way of contrast),
<i>John Bull Done Over</i>. In the first, fat John is enjoying himself with
his pipe and his glass; the sleek condition of his dog shows that it
shares in the comforts of its master&rsquo;s prosperity. John, in fact, has
what our Transatlantic cousins call &ldquo;a good time;&rdquo; scattered over
the floor lie invoices of goods despatched by him to customers in
Spain, in Russia, in America. Beneath a portrait of &ldquo;Good Queen
Bess,&rdquo; John has pinned several of his favourite ballads: &ldquo;The Land
we live in,&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, the Roast Beef of Old England!&rdquo; &ldquo;May we all live
the days of our life.&rdquo; In <i>John Bull Done Over</i>, a very different picture
is presented to our notice. The whole of John&rsquo;s fat is gone; he
sits, a lean, starving, tattered, shoeless object in a bottomless chair,
the embodiment of human misery. In place of his invoices lie
the <i>Gazette</i>, which announces his bankruptcy, and a number of
tradesmen&rsquo;s bills; on the back of his chair is coiled a rope, and on
the table before him a razor lies on a treatise on suicide,&mdash;John in
fact is debating by what mode he shall put an end to his existence.
An onion and some water in a broken jug are the only articles of
sustenance he has to depend on. The tax gatherer, who has made
a number of fruitless calls, looks through the broken panes to
ascertain if John is really &ldquo;at home.&rdquo; On the wall, in place of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>61</span>
picture of &ldquo;Good Queen Bess,&rdquo; hangs a portrait of John Bellingham,
the assassin of Spencer Perceval; and in lieu of his once joyous
ballads, such doleful ditties as &ldquo;Oh, dear, what can the matter be!&rdquo;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nae luck about the house,&rdquo; and so on. The poor dog,
grown like his master a lean and pitiable object, vainly appeals to
him for food.</p>

<p>&ldquo;England&rsquo;s hope&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_21" href="#Footnote_21"><span class="sp">21</span></a>&mdash;the darling of the nation&mdash;the amiable and
interesting Princess Charlotte, whose loss is still lamented after the
lapse of more than half a century, died in childbirth on the 6th of
November, 1817; but on the 24th of May, 1819, was born, at
Kensington Palace, another amiable and august princess, whose life
has been most happily spared to us&mdash;her present Majesty Queen
Victoria. To show that the influence of the last century caricaturists
had not yet left us, this auspicious event immediately gave rise to a
coarse caricature,<a name="FnAnchor_22" href="#Footnote_22"><span class="sp">22</span></a> published by Fores, and labelled, <i>A Scene in the
New Farce called the Rivals, or a Visit to the Heir Presumptive</i>, in
which the scurrilous satirist depicts the supposed mortification and
jealousy of other members of the royal family. Her Majesty&rsquo;s
father, the Duke of Kent, died nine months afterwards, on the 23rd
of January, 1820.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<h5><i>MISCELLANEOUS CARICATURES AND SUBJECTS OF
CARICATURE, 1820-1830.</i></h5>

<p>As in 1809 a revengeful and unscrupulous woman had succeeded in
<span class="sn">Caroline of Brunswick.</span>
exposing the reputation of a member of the Royal family to public
opprobrium, so, in like manner, in 1820, a woman, and no less a
person in this instance than a titular queen of England, was the
means of dragging the crown itself through the mire of a disreputable
scandal. That Caroline of Brunswick was an uncongenial and
unfitting consort; that she was an utterly unfit and improper person
to occupy the exalted position of Queen of England, there can be no
manner of doubt. But to the question whether it was wise, politic,
or dignified to subject her conduct (however morally criminal) to the
reproach of a public investigation, there can be but one answer.</p>

<p>The marriage of Caroline, daughter of Charles, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel,
with George, Prince of Wales, was solemnized
on the 8th of April, 1795. Exactly one year afterwards, and three
months after the birth of their child, the Princess Charlotte, the pair
separated. The separation was effected at the instance of the
prince, and the reasons for his wishing to live apart from her are
assigned in a letter which he sent her Royal Highness through Lord
Cholmondeley: &ldquo;Our <i>inclinations</i>,&rdquo; he told her, &ldquo;are not in our
own power; nor should either be answerable to the other because
nature has not made us suitable to each other. Tranquil and comfortable
society is, however, in our power; let our intercourse therefore
be restricted to <i>that</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sixty years have elapsed since this miserable woman died, and we
who are no longer biassed by the political leanings which more or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>63</span>
less influenced those who regarded her with favour or prejudice, are
enabled to consider the circumstances from a fair and dispassionate
point of view. In order that the reader may form his own conclusions
of her character and disposition, we prefer to quote
authorities whose political sympathies were distinctly favourable to
her cause. Writing of his grandmother, Lady de Clifford (governess
of the Princess Charlotte), Lord Albermarle tells us: &ldquo;She [Lady
de Clifford] used often to recount to me the events of her court life.
The behaviour of the Princess of Wales (this was before she left
England) naturally came under review. I fear that the judgment
she formed of the conduct of this much sinned against and sinning
lady coincides but too closely with the verdict that public opinion
has since passed upon her. To Lady de Clifford she was the source
of constant anxiety and annoyance. Often, when in obedience to
the king&rsquo;s [George III.] commands, my grandmother took her young
charge to the Charlton Villa, the Princess of Wales would behave
with a <i>levity of manner and language that the presence of her child and
her child&rsquo;s governess were insufficient to restrain</i>. On more than one
occasion, Lady de Clifford was obliged to threaten her with making
such a representation to the king as would tend to deprive her
altogether of the Princess Charlotte&rsquo;s society. These remonstrances
were always taken in good part, and produced promises of amendment.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_23" href="#Footnote_23"><span class="sp">23</span></a>
The Hon. Amelia Murray tells us in her &ldquo;Recollections
from 1803 to 1837&rdquo;: &ldquo;There was about this period an extravagant
<i>furore</i> in the cause of the Princess of Wales. She was considered an
ill-treated woman, and that was enough to arouse popular feeling.
My brother was among the young men who helped to give her an
ovation at the opera. A few days afterwards he went to breakfast
at a place near Woolwich. There he saw the princess, in a gorgeous
dress, which was looped up to show her petticoat covered
with stars, with silver wings on her shoulders, sitting under a tree,
<i>with a pot of porter on her knee</i>; and as a finale to the gaiety, she
had the doors opened of every room in the house, and selecting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>64</span>
a partner, she galloped through them, desiring all the guests to
follow her example! It may be guessed whether the gentlemen were
anxious to clap her at the opera again.&rdquo; Now this was the personage
whom certain classes of the community persisted in regarding, sixty
years ago, as a royal martyr. Small as is the respect or esteem
which we owe to the memory of George the Fourth, we may almost
sympathise with him when he calls such a consort &ldquo;uncongenial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A person so little fitted for the high position which she occupied
was certain to give trouble; and as far back as 1806, her indiscreet
conduct had induced the king [George III.] to grant a commission
to Lords Spencer, Grenville, Erskine, and Ellenborough, to examine
into the truth of certain allegations which had been made against
her; and, although their report expressed the most unqualified
opinion that the graver charges were utterly destitute of foundation,
such report, nevertheless, concluded with some strictures made by the
commissioners &ldquo;on the levity of manners displayed by the princess
on certain occasions.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_24" href="#Footnote_24"><span class="sp">24</span></a> In consequence of this official report, the
intercourse between the Princess of Wales and her daughter, the
Princess Charlotte, was subjected to regulation and restraint; they
were allowed at first a single weekly interview, which, for some
doubtless sufficient reason, was afterwards reduced to a fortnightly
meeting.<a name="FnAnchor_25" href="#Footnote_25"><span class="sp">25</span></a></p>

<p>While pitying the mother, we seem scarcely justified in assuming,
with our present knowledge of her obstinate nature and disposition,
that these restrictions were imposed without some just and sufficient
reason. It would seem to have come to the knowledge of the
Princess Caroline in 1813, that the interdiction was intended &ldquo;to be
still more rigidly enforced,&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_26" href="#Footnote_26"><span class="sp">26</span></a> for on the 14th of January of that year
we find that she wrote a letter to the Prince Regent, in which she
complained that the separation of mother and daughter was equally
injurious to her own character and to the education of her child.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>65</span>
Adverting to the restricted intercourse between them, she observed
that in the eyes of the world, &ldquo;this separation of a daughter from
her mother would only admit ... of a construction fatal to
the mother&rsquo;s reputation. Your Royal Highness,&rdquo; she continued,
&ldquo;will pardon me for adding that there is no less inconsistency than
injustice in this treatment. He who dares advise your Highness to
overlook the evidence of my innocence, and disregard the sentence
of complete acquittal which it [<i>i.e.</i> the inquiry of 1806] produced&mdash;or
is wicked and false enough still to whisper suspicions in your ear,
betrays his duty to you, sir, to your daughter, and to your people, if
he counsels you to permit a day to pass <i>without a further investigation
of my conduct</i>.... Let me implore you to reflect on the
situation in which I am placed, without the shadow of a charge
against me, without even an accuser after an inquiry that led to my
ample vindication, yet treated as if I were still more culpable <i>than
the perjuries of my suborned traducers represented me</i>, and held up to
the world as a mother who may not enjoy the society of her only
child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No possible objection can be taken to this letter; indeed, by
whomsoever it was penned, taken altogether it was an admirable
composition. If, however, we are to credit the statement of Mr.
Whitbread, made in the House on the 5th of March, 1813, it was
thrice returned to the writer unopened. But the princess, as we
shall find, was not a person to be intimidated by any amount of
rebuffs. &ldquo;At length that letter [we quote Mr. Whitbread] was read
to him [the Prince Regent], and the cold answer returned was, that
ministers had received no commands on the subject.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_27" href="#Footnote_27"><span class="sp">27</span></a> The letter
found its way into the public prints, and then, and not till then, if
we are to believe Mr. Whitbread, his Royal Highness directed that
the whole of the documents, together with her Royal Highness&rsquo;s
communications to himself, should be referred to certain members of
the Privy Council, who were to report to him their opinion, &ldquo;whether
under all the circumstances ... it was fit and proper that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>66</span>
intercourse between the Princess of Wales and her daughter ...
should continue to be, subject to regulations and restrictions.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_28" href="#Footnote_28"><span class="sp">28</span></a></p>

<p>In their report, which was presented on the 19th of February,
the commissioners stated that &ldquo;they had taken into their most
serious consideration, together with the other papers referred to by
His Royal Highness, all the documents relative to the inquiry
instituted in 1806 ... into the truth of certain representations
respecting ... the Princess of Wales; and, that after full
examination of all the documents before them, they were of opinion,
that under all the circumstances of the case, it was highly fit and
proper, with a view to the welfare of ... the Princess Charlotte
... and the most important interests of the State, that the
intercourse between ... the Princess of Wales and the ...
Princess Charlotte should continue to be subject to regulation
and restraint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was only natural, of course, that Caroline should rebel; and she
accordingly wrote on the 1st of March a letter to the Speaker,
protesting against the mode in which this second inquiry had been
conducted. Motions on her behalf were afterwards brought forward
successively in the House by Mr. Cockrane Johnson and Mr.
Whitbread, both of which, however, fell to the ground. The remarks
made by Mr. Whitbread provoked a speech in the House of Lords
from Lord Ellenborough (who had been a member of both commissions),
which is singularly illustrative of the habits and manners
of the time. After an introduction of great solemnity, his lordship
said, &ldquo;that, in the case alluded to, the persons intrusted with the
commission [of 1806] were charged with having fabricated an
unauthorised document, purporting to relate what was not given in
evidence, and to suppress what was given. This accusation,&rdquo;
said his lordship, &ldquo;is as false as h&mdash;&mdash; in every particular.&rdquo;  He
then proceeded to give an account of the mode in which everything
had been taken down from the mouth of the witness, and
afterwards read over to and subscribed by her.<a name="FnAnchor_29" href="#Footnote_29"><span class="sp">29</span></a> He concluded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>67</span>
his peculiarly energetic speech by again denying, in the most positive
terms, the truth of the imputation which had been cast upon the
commissioners.</p>

<p>The inquiry of 1813 set the pencils of the caricaturists in motion,
and among the satires it occasioned, I find a series of eight pictures
on one sheet, representing the witnesses, the commissioners,
Mr. Whitbread, and other persons connected with that and the
previous investigation of 1806. It is called <i>A Key to the Investigation,
or Iago Distanced by Odds</i>; and the most amusing of the series
is the seventh, which represents the furious Lord Ellenborough,
attired in his official robes of Lord Chief Justice of the King&rsquo;s
Bench. The following doggerel clearly identifies it with the speech
from which we have already quoted:&mdash;</p>

<p>The eighth of the series is &ldquo;the spring that set all in motion,&rdquo; the
satirist&rsquo;s meaning being indicated by a throne, on which lies a
cocked hat adorned with the Prince of Wales&rsquo; feathers, and beneath
it, as is usual in a large proportion of the satires which allude to
the prince-regent, a number of empty bottles.</p>

<p>The Regent seems never to have lost an opportunity of insulting
his uncongenial and unfortunate wife. In anticipation of the expected
visit of the allied sovereigns in June, 1814, the prince
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>68</span>
conveyed an intimation to his royal mother that, as he considered his
presence could not be dispensed with at her ensuing drawing-rooms,
he desired it to be distinctly understood, &ldquo;for reasons of which he
alone could be the judge, to be his fixed and unalterable determination
not to meet the Princess of Wales upon any occasion, either
in public or private.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_32" href="#Footnote_32"><span class="sp">32</span></a> Queen Charlotte was bound of course to
give an official intimation to that effect to the Princess Caroline,
which, on the 24th and 26th of May, 1814, brought from her letters
to the queen and the Regent. In the first of these communications
she intimated her intention of &ldquo;making public the cause of her
absence from Court at a time when the duties of her station would
otherwise peculiarly demand her attendance&rdquo;; while her letter to
her husband contained the following intimation: &ldquo;Your Royal Highness
may possibly refuse to read this letter; but the world must
know that I have written it, and they will see my real motives for
foregoing in this instance the rights of my rank. Occasions,
however, may arise (one, I trust, is far distant) when I <i>must</i> appear
in public, and your Royal Highness must be present also. Can
your Royal Highness have contemplated the full extent of your
declaration? Has your Royal Highness forgotten the approaching
marriage of our daughter [to the Prince of Orange] and the possibility
of our coronation?&rdquo; These words show that from the first
Caroline had decided, <i>coûte que coûte</i>, when the time came to assert
her position, in spite of the opposition of her husband and any
obstacles which might be raised by his friends and advisers.</p>

<p>We have entered rather fully into this matter, because it seemed
to us necessary, in order that the reader might understand the
temper of Caroline, and the motives which influenced her in the
extraordinary course of conduct which she afterwards thought fit
to pursue. She was treated, we have seen, with the most cruel and
studied insult; excluded from ceremonials at which her rank and
position entitled her to be present. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the unfortunate
woman in the letter to her husband to which we have alluded, &ldquo;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>69</span>
time you have selected for this proceeding is calculated to make it
peculiarly galling. Many illustrious strangers are already arrived
in England; among others, as I am informed, the illustrious heir
of the house of Orange, who has announced himself to me as my
future son-in-law. From their society I am unjustly excluded.
Others are expected, of rank equal to your own, to rejoice with your
Royal Highness in the peace of Europe. My daughter will for
the first time appear in the splendour and publicity becoming the
approaching nuptials of the presumptive heiress of this empire.
This season your Royal Highness has chosen for treating me with
great and unprovoked indignity; and of all his Majesty&rsquo;s subjects,
I alone am prevented by your Royal Highness from appearing in
my place, to partake of the general joy, and am deprived of the
indulgence of those feelings of pride and affection permitted to
every mother but me.&rdquo; Poor mother! who may help pitying her!
Her most prejudiced enemy will admit that this was an eloquent
and noble protest. Had she only maintained this language and
attitude, we should justly assign to her a place amongst the royal
martyrs of history. Naturally this barbarous, impolitic treatment
soured her, as it would sour even the sweetest disposition. In an
evil hour for her, and we may add for this country, she solicited
and obtained permission to travel abroad.</p>

<p>No sooner was she freed from the restraints which had surrounded
her at home, than her conduct not only makes us doubt whether
she had any hand in the composition of this maternal appeal, but
appears to justify the conclusions at which the commissioners of
1806 and 1813 seem to have arrived. Her temper was obstinate
and wilful. She knew that she was watched; and from a spirit apparently
of wanton mischief, designed with the view doubtless of
annoying her enemies, she indulged in a series of the most extraordinary
and undignified vagaries. She took into her service and
received into her closest confidence and favour persons of the
lowest position. It was impossible for rumours of her extraordinary
eccentricities not to reach, not only the ears of those who detested
her, but in an imperfect and incorrect degree those of the general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>70</span>
public. That this was the case is shown by a caricature entitled,
<i>Paving the way for a Royal Divorce</i>, published by Johnston on the
1st of October, 1816, in which we see the corpulent Regent at table
with Lord Liverpool, &ldquo;Old Bags&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_33" href="#Footnote_33"><span class="sp">33</span></a> (Chancellor Eldon), Lord Chief
Justice Ellenborough, Vansittart, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and
another, probably intended for Viscount Sidmouth. His Royal
Highness is made by the caricaturist to say that he and his sympathizers
think &ldquo;we shall now succeed, having secured some evidence
from the coast of Barbary.... I have got everything as clear
as the sun at noon-day.... Now for a divorce as soon as
possible.&rdquo; Lord Chancellor Eldon says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stick to your Highness
through thick and thin, or never call me &lsquo;Old Bags&rsquo; again as
long as I live.&rdquo; Lord Liverpool supports him by the assurance,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an unmatched negotiator, and I&rsquo;ll enter into a treaty with the
House of Commons to secure your suit.&rdquo; The temper of the Commons
is shown by the doubts expressed by the individual we take to
be intended for Viscount Sidmouth. &ldquo;I have my doubts,&rdquo; says this
person, at the same time laying his hands on the port wine decanter,
&ldquo;I have my doubts and qualms of conscience, your Highness; what
say you, Van?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, my lord,&rdquo; replies Vansittart, who is seated
on the &ldquo;Budget,&rdquo; &ldquo;I have some strange touches of feeling on the
subject.&rdquo; Up rises the hot-tempered Lord Chief Justice, upsetting
a decanter of port wine, and at the same time the chair on which
he has been sitting, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put me in a passion with your
&rsquo;qualms&rsquo; and your &lsquo;touches&rsquo;; they are all false, false as h&mdash;&mdash;!
I&rsquo;ll blow you all to the d&mdash;&mdash;l if you don&rsquo;t stick to your master
manfully!!&rdquo; By the side of the prince we see, as usual, a pailful
of wine bottles, and at his feet, in allusion to his notorious infidelities,
an open volume entitled, &ldquo;The Secret Memoirs of a
Prince, by Humphrey Hedghog, Esq., 1815.&rdquo; By the side of the
Lord Chief Justice lie three portly volumes labelled, &ldquo;The Law of
Divorce.&rdquo; It will be evident from the foregoing, that from an early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>71</span>
period, the satirists on the popular side gave credit to the prince
and his advisers for being members of a secret conspiracy for compassing
the ruin of the erring and unfortunate woman.</p>

<p>Now what was the &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; to which the corpulent Regent
is made to refer in the sketch before us? It was not of course
<i>evidence</i>, but rumour; and rumour said the strangest things of the
Princess Caroline. It associated her name with that of a courier,&mdash;a
low Italian, named Bartolomeo Bergami; it said that she had
enriched and ennobled this man and other members of his family;
procured for him a barony in Sicily; decorated him with several
orders of knighthood; and asserted in the plainest terms that she
was living with him in a state of open and notorious adultery.
These reports rendered it necessary to ascertain on what foundation
they rested, and the result was that in 1818, Mr. Cooke, of the
Chancery Bar, and Mr. Powell, a solicitor, were despatched into
Germany and Italy to collect evidence with respect to her conduct.
This inquiry, which is generally known as the &ldquo;Milan Commission,&rdquo;
seemed certainly preferable to an investigation of a more public
and notorious character; and upon the evidence these gentlemen
obtained was founded the &ldquo;Bill of Pains and Penalties,&rdquo; which we
shall presently have to consider.</p>

<p>It is quite clear that the ministers of 1820 were strongly averse
<span class="sn">1820.</span>
to the introduction of the &ldquo;Bill of Pains and Penalties,&rdquo; which is
now known to us as the &ldquo;Trial of Queen Caroline.&rdquo; The whole
odium indeed of the proceedings rested upon them at the time;
but we have no reason to doubt the statement of Mr. Charles
Greville, under date of 20th February, 1820, that they had offered
to resign, &ldquo;because the king would not hear reason.&rdquo; It seems
at any rate tolerably certain that, although they brought forward
the &ldquo;Bill of Pains and Penalties&rdquo; under pressure of the Crown,
they did not do so until they had well-nigh exhausted every effort
short of actual resignation (this dignified position they did <i>not</i> take)
to avoid it. Mr. Wade tells us that &ldquo;their first indiscretion consisted
in commencing hostilities against the queen by the omission
of her name in the liturgy, thereby provoking her claim to legal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>72</span>
rights;&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_34" href="#Footnote_34"><span class="sp">34</span></a> but this omission, which appears to us justifiable under
the circumstances, Mr. Greville shows us was due to the action
of the king himself.<a name="FnAnchor_35" href="#Footnote_35"><span class="sp">35</span></a> In the month of June, 1819, a communication
appears to have been received from Mr. Brougham, the professional
adviser of the princess, and understood to be charged with
the confidential management of her affairs. The proposal contained
in this communication was in substance, that her then income of
£35,000 a year should be secured to her for life, instead of terminating
with the demise of the crown: and that she should undertake
upon that arrangement being made to reside permanently abroad,
and not to assume at any time the rank or title of Queen of England.
This proposal, however, being stated to be made without any
authority from the princess, or knowledge of it on her part, the
Government at that time replied that there would be no indisposition
at the proper time to entertain the principle on which the
proposal was grounded, if it met with the approbation of her Royal
Highness on the king&rsquo;s accession. The ministers, reverting to Mr.
Brougham&rsquo;s proposal, offered to raise the already handsome allowance
to £50,000 a year, subject to the conditions before mentioned.
Caroline, however, peremptorily declined the proposal, alleging that
it had been made without her knowledge or sanction. Unfortunately,
too, this offer when made to Caroline herself, was coupled
with the intimation that if the queen should &ldquo;be so ill-advised as
to come over to this country, there must be <i>an end to all negotiations
and compromise</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_36" href="#Footnote_36"><span class="sp">36</span></a> Considering the temper and disposition of the
woman, the fact that she had demanded the insertion of her name
in the liturgy, the haughty assertion of her claim &ldquo;to be received
and acknowledged as the Queen of England,&rdquo; and the communication
made at the same time of her desire that a royal yacht should
be in readiness to receive her at Calais,<a name="FnAnchor_37" href="#Footnote_37"><span class="sp">37</span></a> it appears to us a greater
mistake on the part of the ministry could scarcely have been made.
It aroused her woman&rsquo;s nature, and flaming with the anger and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>73</span>
resentment which she had nourished for so long a course of years,
she boldly took up the gauntlet her enemies had flung at her feet,
and crossed the Channel almost as soon as the astonished Government
messenger himself.</p>

<p>The queen (for she was titular Queen of England now) arrived
in London on the 7th of June: &ldquo;the road was thronged with an
immense multitude the whole way from Westminster Bridge to
Greenwich. Carriages, carts, and horsemen followed, preceded,
and surrounded her coach the whole way. She was everywhere
received with the greatest enthusiasm. Women waved pocket-handkerchiefs,
and men shouted wherever she passed. She travelled
in an open landau, Alderman Wood sitting by her side, and Lady
Ann Hamilton [the Duke of Hamilton&rsquo;s sister] and another woman
opposite.... The queen looked exactly as she did before
she left England, and seemed neither dispirited nor dismayed.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_38" href="#Footnote_38"><span class="sp">38</span></a>
In one of the popular satires of the day we see her standing on the
balcony of Alderman Wood&rsquo;s house in South Audley Street, receiving
and acknowledging the enthusiastic plaudits of her admirers. The
very day she arrived at Dover, a royal message was sent down to
Parliament, by which the king commended to the Lords an inquiry
into the conduct of the queen; while on the following day, Mr.
Brougham read in the House of Commons a message or manifesto
from his client, declaring that her return was occasioned by the
necessity her enemies had laid upon her of defending her character
and conduct.</p>

<p>Both parties now stood irrevocably committed to the fatal
<span class="sn">The Bill of Pains and Penalties.</span>
measure. A secret committee of the House of Lords proceeded
to open the celebrated <i>green bag</i>, which contained the reports of the
Milan Commission; and on the 4th of July they made their report,
recommending a solemn inquiry into the conduct of the queen.
Next day the Earl of Liverpool presented a &ldquo;bill of pains and
penalties&rdquo; entitled, &ldquo;An Act to deprive Her Majesty Queen Caroline
Amelia Elizabeth of the title, prerogative, rights, privileges, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>74</span>
exemptions of Queen Consort of this realm, and to dissolve the
marriage between His Majesty and the said Caroline Amelia
Elizabeth&rdquo; on the ground of the grossly immoral conduct therein
alleged against her.</p>

<p>The ill-advised proceedings once commenced, no time was lost
in carrying them through. On the 7th of July the Italian witnesses
in support of the bill (twelve in number) landed at Dover. The
object of their visit soon became known, and on emerging from the
custom house they were set upon and badly beaten by a furious
crowd, composed principally of women. They were lodged in a
building then separating the old houses of Parliament, which, with
its enclosure, was called Cotton Garden; the front faced the abbey,
the rear the Thames. &ldquo;The land entrance was strongly barricaded.
The side facing Westminster Bridge was shut out from the public
by a wall run up for the express purpose at a right angle to the
Parliament stairs. Thus the only access was by the river. Here
was erected a causeway to low-water mark; a flight of steps led to
the interior of the inclosure. The street was guarded by a strong
military force, the water side by gunboats. An ample supply of
provisions was stealthily (for fear of the mob) introduced into the
building; a bevy of royal cooks was sent to see that the food was
of good quality, and to render it as palatable as their art could
make it. About this building, in which the witnesses were immured
from August till November, the London mob would hover like a cat
round the cage of a canary. Such confinement would have been
intolerable to the natives of any other country, but it was quite in
unison with the feelings of Italians. To them it realized their
favourite &lsquo;<i>dolce far niente</i>.&rsquo; Their only physical exertion appears
to have been the indulgence in that description of dance that the
<i>Pifferari</i> have made familiar to the Londoner.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_39" href="#Footnote_39"><span class="sp">39</span></a> Such was the
residence of the Italian witnesses against the queen, and it is
certain that if they had ventured beyond its precincts they would
have been torn in pieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>75</span></p>

<p>The appearance which Caroline of Brunswick presented at her
trial was an outrageous caricature, and is thus described by one
then distinctly friendly to her cause&mdash;the Earl of Albemarle:
&ldquo;The peers rose as the queen entered, and remained standing
until she took her seat in a crimson and gilt chair immediately in
front of her counsel. Her appearance was anything but prepossessing.
She wore a black dress with a high ruff, an unbecoming gipsy
hat with a huge bow in front, the whole surmounted by a plume of
ostrich feathers. <i>Nature</i> had given her light hair, blue eyes, a fair
complexion, and a good-humoured expression of countenance; but
these characteristics were marred by <i>painted eyebrows</i>, and by a <i>black
wig</i> with a profusion of curls, which overshadowed her cheeks and
gave a bold, defiant air to her features.&rdquo; The names of the witnesses,
and possibly the precise nature of the testimony against her,
would seem to have been unknown to the queen, for we have it on
record that when the first witness (Teodoro Majoochi, the celebrated
&ldquo;Non Mi Ricordo&rdquo;) was placed at the bar, on the 21st of August,
Her Majesty, &ldquo;uttering a loud exclamation, retired hastily from
the House, followed by Lady Ann Hamilton.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_40" href="#Footnote_40"><span class="sp">40</span></a> She evidently
laboured under some strong emotion, whether of surprise or displeasure,
or both, seems never to have been ascertained.</p>

<p>Among the general public, and even in the House of Commons
itself, the falsehood of all that had been alleged on oath against
the queen was assumed as an undeniable axiom; the witnesses
were loaded with the most opprobrious epithets, while those who
had been concerned in collecting or sifting evidence were represented
as conspirators or suborners. We shall see, when we come
to speak of the caricatures of Robert Cruikshank, the light in which
these unhappy witnesses were regarded by the graphic satirists on
the popular side.<a name="FnAnchor_41" href="#Footnote_41"><span class="sp">41</span></a> Nevertheless, if their testimony is carefully read
over by any unprejudiced person having any knowledge of the law
of evidence, in spite of the badgering of Mr. Brougham, the admirable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>76</span>
speech of that gentleman, and the testimony of the witnesses
on the other side, I think he cannot fail to come to any other
conclusion than that expressed by the then Lord Ellenborough, that
Her Royal Highness was &ldquo;the last woman a man of honour would
wish his wife to resemble, or the father of a family would recommend
as an example to his daughters. No man,&rdquo; said his lordship,
&ldquo;could put his hand on his heart and say that the queen was
not wholly unfit to hold the situation which she holds.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_42" href="#Footnote_42"><span class="sp">42</span></a> He will
see too, by reference to the report of the proceedings in the &ldquo;Annual
Register,&rdquo; that of the peers who decided to vote against the second
reading of the bill on the ground of <i>inexpediency</i>, a large majority
gave it as their deliberate opinion that the case had been proved
against the queen.<a name="FnAnchor_43" href="#Footnote_43"><span class="sp">43</span></a> In a very clever pictorial satire, published by
S. Humphrey in 1821, the queen, Bergami, and a third figure
(possibly intended for Alderman Wood) are represented as standing
on a pedestal forming the apex of a slender stem labelled &ldquo;Mobility,&rdquo;
which rests on a base marked &ldquo;Adultery.&rdquo; The whole
structure depends for support on a broom (in allusion of course to
Mr. Brougham) and two frail pieces of wood, labelled respectively,
&ldquo;Sham addresses,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sham processions,&rdquo; which in turn rest on
a slender railing, while a ladder on either side, marked &ldquo;Brass&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Wood,&rdquo; lend a further slight support to the very insecure fabric.
The superincumbent weight of the queen and Bergami breaks the
frail stem in pieces, and the three figures tumble to the ground
together. The back of the design is occupied with scenes and
incidents detailed in the evidence. A very clever caricature, without
date (published by T. Sidebotham), I am inclined to assign to
this period; and if so, it is one of the most plain spoken and telling
satires ever published. It is entitled, <i>City Scavengers Cleansing the
London Streets of Impurities</i>; a placard which has fallen in the
street sufficiently explains its meaning: &ldquo;By particular desire of the
Society for the Suppression of Vice, D&mdash; of K&mdash;t in the chair,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>77</span>
ordered that the city officers do keep the streets clear of common
prostitutes.&mdash;Signed, Wood, Mayor.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_44" href="#Footnote_44"><span class="sp">44</span></a></p>

<p>A more foolish and undignified proceeding, however, than this
&ldquo;Bill of Pains and Penalties&rdquo; can scarcely be conceived. Its fate
might almost have been predicted from the first. The second
reading was carried on the 6th of November, by a majority of
twenty-eight, but the third (for the reasons already given) by a
majority of nine only; whereupon, the Earl of Liverpool said that,
&ldquo;had the third reading been carried by as considerable a number
of peers as the second had been, he and his colleagues would have
felt it their duty to persevere with the bill and to send it down
to the other branch of the legislature. In the present state of the
country, however, ... they had come to the determination
not to proceed further with it.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_45" href="#Footnote_45"><span class="sp">45</span></a>  The victory will be acknowledged
by us now-a-days as damaging as a defeat; but the result, curious
to relate, was hailed by the queen and her party as if her innocence
had been triumphantly vindicated. In signing a document prepared
by her counsel on the 8th of November, she wrote, &ldquo;Carolina
Regina,&rdquo; adding the words, &ldquo;there, <i>Regina</i> still, in spite of them.&rdquo;
The abandonment of the bill was followed by three nights of
illumination; but it was observed that they were of a very partial
character, wholly unlike those which had greeted the great victories
by sea and land, in which the public sympathy was spontaneous
and universal. The mob in some cases testified its disapproval
when these signs of satisfaction were wanting; and one gentleman
in Bond Street, on being repeatedly requested to &ldquo;light up,&rdquo; placed
a single rushlight in his two-pair-of-stairs window. Some of the
transparencies were, as might have been expected, of a singular
character. A trunk maker in the same street displayed the following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>78</span>
new reading from Genesis: &ldquo;And God said, It is not good
the King should reign alone.&rdquo; A publican at the corner of Half
Moon Street exhibited a flag whereon, in reference to the unpopular
witness Teodoro Majoochi, was depicted a gallows with the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;<i>Q.</i> What&rsquo;s that for?</p>
<p class="i05"><i>A.</i> Non Mi Ricordo.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>An enthusiastic cheesemonger at the top of Great Queen Street
displayed a transparency on which he had inscribed the following
verses:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p class="i05">It gave up the ghost</p>
  <p class="i2">And died 53 days after birth.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The caricaturists of course were not idle, and the trial of Queen
Caroline provoked a perfect legion of pictorial satires. The queen&rsquo;s
victory is celebrated in one of the contemporary caricatures
(published by John Marshall, junior) under the title of <i>The Queen
Caroline Running down the Royal George</i>; while on the ministerial
side it is recorded (among others) by a far more elaborate and
valuable performance (published by G. Humphrey), called, <i>The
Steward&rsquo;s Court of the Manor of Torre Devon</i>, which contains an
immense number of figures, and wherein the queen is seated on
a black ram<a name="FnAnchor_46" href="#Footnote_46"><span class="sp">46</span></a> in the midst of one of the popular processions, the
members of which carry poles bearing pictorial records of the
various events brought out in evidence against her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>79</span></p>

<p>It is one of the peculiarities of our &ldquo;Glorious Constitution,&rdquo;
that while the ministers who acted under his direction incurred
all the blame, the prime instigator of all these exposures was enabled
to shelter himself behind the backs of his &ldquo;advisers.&rdquo; The
ministers were unpopular,&mdash;they deserved to be so, for, whatever
might have been the consequences to themselves so far as loss
of office was concerned, they should have refused from the first
to lend themselves to the publication of a scandal so utterly
grievous. The king himself at this time was far from unpopular;
the odium he had incurred the previous year by the thanks he had
caused to be conveyed to Major Trafford, &ldquo;and the officers, non-commissioned
officers, and privates&rdquo; of the yeomanry who had
signalized themselves in the massacre at Manchester (an outrage
which, by the way, led to a number of pictorial satires), seemed
to have wholly passed away. He was at Ascot only two days
before the queen&rsquo;s arrival, and &ldquo;was always cheered by the mob
as he went away. One day only a man in the crowd called out
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the Queen?&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_47" href="#Footnote_47"><span class="sp">47</span></a> Again, we find on the same authority,
that on the night of the 6th of February, 1821: &ldquo;The king went
to the play (Drury Lane) for the first time, the Dukes of York
and Clarence and a great suite with him. He was received with
immense acclamations, the whole pit standing up, hurrahing and
waving their hats. The boxes were very empty at first, for the
mob occupied the avenues to the theatre, and those who had
engaged boxes could not get to them. The crowd on the outside
was very great.... A few people called &lsquo;The Queen!&rsquo; but
very few. A man in the gallery called out, &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s your wife,
Georgy?&rsquo;<a name="FnAnchor_48" href="#Footnote_48"><span class="sp">48</span></a> His reception at Covent Garden the following night
appears to have been equally loyal and gratifying.</p>

<p>The truth was, that the numerous and truly honest people who
sympathized with Queen Caroline, did so from little admiration
for herself, but because she had been the victim of twenty-five
years&rsquo; persecution; because, however great her follies, they had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>80</span>
grievously provoked; and above all, because they felt that the man
who was her most powerful and relentless persecutor, was the
very last who was justified in casting a stone against her. The
ministerialists and their supporters, however, attributed the sympathy
which was shown by her professed admirers exclusively to a political
origin, and thus stigmatized the motives of their opponents (with
more justice than poetry) in one of the jingling rhymes of the
day:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Queen to Reformists? as Queen was to France,</p>
<p class="i05">Round her head and her consort&rsquo;s they&rsquo;d equally dance.</p>
<p class="i05">They care not for Caroline, nor king, nor for queen,</p>
<p class="i05">A pretext they want their intentions to screen,</p>
<p class="i05">&rsquo;The Queen!&rsquo; is the Radicals&rsquo; rallying cry;</p>
<p class="i05">A queen bears the standard the king to defy.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>How entirely unfitted this mistaken woman was to figure in the
august position of a queen of England may be judged from her
subsequent conduct. Instead of contenting herself with her victory,
such as it was, she had the ill taste, in spite of the remonstrances
of her friends and advisers, to communicate to the Lord Mayor,
through the medium of her &ldquo;vice chamberlain,&rdquo; her intention to
proceed to St. Paul&rsquo;s in a public manner on Wednesday, the 29th
of November, there and then to offer up her thanksgivings for
the result: and this resolution she actually carried out. The details
of her procession, which really reminds us of the entry of a
company of equestrians into some provincial town, need not be
entered into here; suffice it to say that it comprised trumpeters
without number, stewards&rsquo; carriages, gentlemen on horseback, the
corpulent queen herself, with her attendant, Lady Ann Hamilton,
and the indispensable Alderman Wood, the whole closing with
&ldquo;the various trades with flags and banners.&rdquo; It would appear
to us that one of the rarest of the caricatures on the ministerial
side has reference to this triumphal entry. It is labelled, <i>Grand
Entrance to Bamboozlem</i>, and was published by Humphrey shortly
afterwards. The queen is represented at the head of a procession,
all the members of which (herself included) are mounted on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>81</span>
braying &ldquo;jackasses.&rdquo; A figure, intended no doubt for Alderman
Wood, habited in a fool&rsquo;s cap and jester&rsquo;s dress, holds her by the
hand; the lady who follows him, playing on the fiddle and wearing
a Scotch bonnet, is meant for Lady Ann Hamilton (she is named
&ldquo;Lady Ann Bagpipe&rdquo; in the sketch); Bergami (immediately
behind) carries a banner inscribed &ldquo;Innocence&rdquo;; and next him,
his fat sister, whom the queen had dignified with the title of a
countess; Venus and Bacchus appear amongst the crowd, and are
labelled &ldquo;Protégés and bosom friends of Her M&mdash;&mdash;y.&rdquo;  She is
welcomed by an enthusiastic body of butchers with marrow-bones
and cleavers; while among the crowd waiting to receive her we
notice Orator Hunt and the other popular leaders of the day.</p>

<p>And here we drop for the present the subject of Queen Caroline,
a subject we have approached with caution, although conscious
that it can be by no means omitted from a work treating of
graphic satires of the nineteenth century. That she should now
accept the £50,000 per annum which she had previously refused,
will probably not surprise the reader. The end of a career so
strangely undignified will be seen when we come to treat of the
caricatures of George Cruikshank.</p>

<p>The duel between the Dukes of Buckingham and Bedford; the
erection of the statue of Achilles in Hyde Park; the new Marriage
Act; the second French invasion of Spain under the Duc d&rsquo;Angoulème;
the Tenth Hussars; Miss Foote, the celebrated actress;
Edmund Kean; and the commercial distress of 1825-6, afford
subjects for the pencils of the caricaturists, and will be mentioned
in the chapters which relate to the graphic satires of the brothers
Cruikshank.</p>

<p>The pictorial satirists were kept fully employed by the political
<span class="sn">Greek War of Independence.</span>
events of 1827 and 1828. The former year beheld the sanguinary
Greek war of independence. Things turned out badly for the
over-matched Greeks, until at last Great Britain, France, and Russia
interposed with Turkey on their behalf. The proposals offered were
such as the Turks refused to entertain. The Porte, in refusing
them, maintained that, though mediation might be allowable in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>82</span>
matters of difference between independent states, it was utterly
inadmissible as between a power and its revolted subjects. The
allied powers then proposed an armistice, demanding a reply within
fifteen days, plainly intimating that in the event of refusal or silence
(which would be construed into a refusal), they should resort to
measures for <i>enforcing</i> a suspension of hostilities.</p>

<p>In the meantime arrived at Navarino the Egyptian fleet, consisting
<span class="sn">Battle of Navarino.</span>
of ninety-two sail, including fifty-one transports, having on
board 5,000 fresh troops. Ibraham Pacha&rsquo;s attempt to hoodwink
the British, and to land these troops at Patras, was foiled by the
vigilance and determination of the English admiral. Disappointed
in these attempts, he proceeded, in the teeth of the warnings which
had been given him, to execute his orders to put down the insurrection
on land, and carried them out with merciless atrocity,&mdash;ravaging
the Morea with fire and sword. Resolved now to bring
matters to an issue, the combined fleets in October, 1827, entered
the harbour. As was expected would happen, the Turks fired upon
them, and then ensued the famous battle of Navarino, in which,
after a four hours&rsquo; engagement, the Turkish and Egyptian fleets were
annihilated, and the bay strewed with the remains of their ruined
vessels.</p>

<p>Russia declared war against Turkey the following year, and we
meet with many miscellaneous caricatures having reference to the
conflict which followed. In one, published by Maclean (without
date) entitled, <i>Russian Bears&rsquo; Grease, or a Peep into Futurity</i>, we
see the Russian bear running off with Greece in spite of England,
France, and Austria. Another (also without date), is labelled
<i>The Descent of the Great Bear, or the Mussulmans in a Quandary</i>.
In a third (also without date), called <i>The Nest in Danger</i>, we see
Turkey sitting on a nest marked &ldquo;Greece&rdquo; disturbed by Russia,
whilst the British lion stands looking on at no great distance, discontentedly
gnawing a bone labelled &ldquo;Navarino.&rdquo; By the time
peace was concluded between the belligerents in 1829, England
would seem to have realized the fact that she had been made the
tool of Russia, and this is the obvious idea intended to be conveyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>83</span>
by the satirist in another caricature (also without date, but bearing
obvious reference to the same subject). The Porte is represented
in the act of <i>presenting a bill of indemnification</i> to George the
Fourth.</p>

<p>The principal political topic remaining to be noticed is the
<span class="sn">Catholic Relief Bill.</span>
Catholic Relief Bill of 1829, a measure forced upon the king, the
ministry, the church, and the aristocracy by the imperative force
of circumstances, directed by the prescience of a minister who,
sharing at first all the objections of his colleagues, felt nevertheless
that a large portion of his Majesty&rsquo;s subjects were labouring
under disabilities and fettered by restrictions inconsistent with the
boasted liberties of a free people; and that such a measure, in the
face of the political changes which had been loudly demanded
for a long time past, could no longer be delayed. It is not surprising,
however, that Wellington and his colleagues, following out
the maxims of a Whig policy, should be viewed by their own party
somewhat in the light of traitors. Accordingly we see them figuring
in this character in some of the caricatures of the day, one of
which (one of the &ldquo;Paul Pry&rdquo; series), published by Geans in 1829,
may be cited as an example of the rest, and shows them to us in
the act of <i>Burking Old Mrs. Constitution, aged 141</i>.</p>

<p>In this and the two preceding chapters we have attempted to
give an account of some of the leading events of the first thirty
years of the century, illustrating them by reference to a <i>few</i> of
the miscellaneous caricatures of the period. We have adopted
this method of arrangement because, if our theory be correct, it
was during this period that the art of caricature continued to
flourish, and it is from this period that we date its speedy decline
and downfall. We think that the prime cause of this decline
may be traced to the fact that George Cruikshank, the best of
nineteenth century satirists, had by this time resigned the art to
follow his new employment of an illustrator of books; we think,
too, that caricature received an additional impetus in its downward
progress by the secession from the ranks of its professors
of the veteran Thomas Rowlandson, who, although he did not die
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>84</span>
until 1827, had virtually given up caricature in favour of book
illustration<a name="FnAnchor_49" href="#Footnote_49"><span class="sp">49</span></a> many years before. Further illustration of some of
the events already related, and of others to which we have no occasion
at present to refer, will be found in the chapters devoted to the
work of Isaac Robert Cruikshank and his brother George.</p>

<p>A considerable number of the caricatures which belong to the
first quarter of the century have an anonymous origin; whilst a large
proportion are due to William Heath, who, either in his own name,
or often under the distinguishing hieroglyphic of &ldquo;Paul Pry,&rdquo; contributed
largely to the political and social satires of his day. Other
caricaturists of the period were H. Heath (hundreds of whose
comic sketches were collected and published by Charles Tilt),
Theodore Lane, and his friends Isaac Robert and George Cruikshank.
To these names we must add those of the last century
men who continued their work into the present, James Gillray,
Thomas Rowlandson, George Moutard Woodward, C. Williams,
Henry William Bunbury, Robert Dighton, and others. Some idea
of the industry of the nineteenth century satirists may be gathered
from the fact that the &ldquo;Paul Pry&rdquo; series of political satires of
1829-30, alone number some fifty plates, which in our day can
rarely be purchased at three times their original cost.</p>

<p class="center" style="letter-spacing: 4em;">&nbsp;*******</p>

<p>On the walls of some old-fashioned dining-rooms, and the parlours
<span class="sn">Theodore Lane.</span>
of provincial inns, may still be seen an engraving, called <i>The
Enthusiast</i>, which some of my readers may remember to have seen
in the print shops of some twenty or five-and-twenty years ago. It
represents an old disciple of Izaac Walton, whom the gout has
incapacitated from following his favourite pursuit, so devoted to the
sport, that we see him fishing for minnows in a water-tub, instead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>85</span>
of the rippling stream out of which he has been accustomed to whip
his favourite speckle-backed beauties. The painting from which this
engraving was taken was the work of Theodore Lane, who, although
his work is limited to the short space of five or six years, seems to
call for special mention by virtue of his tragic ending, the short
span allotted to his life and labours, and the superiority of his
talent and genius to those of many of his contemporaries. Lane
was literally a comic artist of the nineteenth century, having been
born at Isleworth in 1800. He was apprenticed to a colourer of
prints at Battle Bridge, named Barrow; and, shortly after completing
his time, produced (in 1822) six designs illustrative of &ldquo;The
Life of an Actor,&rdquo; and with these in a small portfolio under his arm,
went out into the world to seek his fortune as other comic artists
have done before him and since. Pierce Egan, at this time, was
the most popular man in town; his name (on very insufficient
literary merits) was identified with the success of the most famous
book of the century&mdash;we allude to the &ldquo;Life in London.&rdquo; To his
residence in Spann&rsquo;s Buildings, St. Pancras, Lane betook himself;
showed him his sketches, and said if Egan would only undertake
the letterpress, he should find no difficulty in getting Ackermann,
Sherwood, or any of the art publishers of the day, to undertake its
publication. But Egan&rsquo;s hands were full, and he declined the offer.
Two years later on, author and artist again met, and the result was
that &ldquo;The Life of an Actor, Peregrine Proteus,&rdquo; made its appearance,
&ldquo;illustrated by twenty-seven coloured scenes and nine woodcuts,
representing the vicissitudes of the stage.&rdquo; The publisher was
Arnold, of Tavistock Street, Covent Garden, who paid the young
artist one hundred and fifty pounds fifteen shillings for his share of
the work. &ldquo;The Life of an Actor&rdquo; was published at a guinea, and
dedicated to Edmund Kean; and a contemporary critic describes it
as &ldquo;one of the best exemplifications of Mr. Egan&rsquo;s peculiar talent.
It is impossible for us,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;to do justice to the spirit of
the designs, many of which would [of course] not discredit the
pencil of Hogarth.&rdquo; Lane&rsquo;s association with one of the most noted
sporting characters of the day opened the way to him for further
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>86</span>
engagements, and for another work, entitled, &ldquo;A Complete Panorama
of the Sporting World,&rdquo; he executed thirteen original etchings, and
an equal number of designs on wood.</p>

<p>Among the number of Theodore Lane&rsquo;s social satires may be
mentioned <i>Scientific Pursuits, or Hobbyhorse Races to the Temple of
Fame</i>, four folio plates; <i>The Parson&rsquo;s Clerk</i> (a comic song), four
illustrations in ridicule of cant and hypocrisy; <i>Legal Illustrations</i>
(seventy humorous applications of law terms); <i>The Masquerade at
the Argyll Rooms</i> (a large plate full of vigour, life, and character);
<i>New Year&rsquo;s Morning: the Old One out, and the New One coming in</i>, a
party of topers, one of whom&mdash;the chairman, with the empty punch-bowl
on his head (representing &ldquo;the old one out&rdquo;)&mdash;merrily points
at the waiter bringing a full bowl (&ldquo;the new one&rdquo;) in; <i>Sunday
Morning&mdash;the Barber&rsquo;s Shop</i>; <i>Shilling Fare to a Christmas Dinner,
or Just in Pudding Time</i>; <i>The Rival Whiskers</i>; and <i>Amorous,
Clamorous, Uproarious, and Glorious</i> (a pair of admirable and
amusing satires of the prevailing features, vices, and follies of the
day); <i>Crowding to the Pit</i> and <i>Contending for a Seat</i> (two capital
theatrical subjects). Lane also made a sketch entitled, <i>Paul Pry&rsquo;s
First Night in a Boarding House</i>, intended to be succeeded by
eleven others, the publication of which was however prevented by
the death of Liston. McLean published a large and clever design,
bearing the somewhat lengthy title of <i>Law Gorging on the Spoils
of Fools and Rogues, and Honest Men among Knavery, producing
Repentance and Ruin; or, the Fatal Effects of Legal Rapacity</i>,&mdash;wherein
the highway of Law conducts to Ruin through a series of
toll-gates labelled respectively, &ldquo;Opinion of Counsel,&rdquo; &ldquo;Injunction,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Filing the Bill,&rdquo; &ldquo;Consultation,&rdquo; &ldquo;Procrastination,&rdquo; etc.</p>

<p>Like his contemporaries the Cruikshanks, with whom he was
familiar, Theodore Lane mixed freely with the young bloods of his
day, termed in the slang of his time &ldquo;Corinthians,&rdquo; and the results
are shown in his designs. He might often be seen at the &ldquo;Craven&rsquo;s
Head,&rdquo; in Drury Lane, kept by a host known to his patrons by the
familiar title of &ldquo;Billy Oxberry&rdquo;; at the Saturday night harmonic
meetings held at the &ldquo;Kean&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo; in Russell Court, Drury Lane;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>87</span>
at &ldquo;The Wrekin,&rdquo; in Broad Court, Long Acre, at that time frequented
by gentlemen of the Press; at &ldquo;The Harp,&rdquo; in Russell Street, Drury
Lane, a well known house of call for actors, and appropriately
immortalised in one of his illustrations to &ldquo;The Life of an Actor&rdquo;;
at the &ldquo;Cider Cellar&rdquo;; at the &ldquo;Fives Court&rdquo;; at the numerous
&ldquo;Masquerades&rdquo; of the day; at any place of resort, in fact, which
offered studies of life and character or subjects of social satire. He
figures in his own sketch of <i>The Masquerade at the Argyll Rooms</i>,
where we recognise him (in one of the right hand boxes) in a white
sheet, a tall paper cap on his head, and a staff in his hand. His
impersonations were sometimes singularly original. At one of these
&ldquo;masquerades,&rdquo; for instance, he represented a &ldquo;frozen-out gardener&rdquo;
soliciting charity, and holding in his hand a cabbage covered with
icicles; at another, he appeared as a hospital &ldquo;out-patient,&rdquo; wearing
a hideous mask (designed by himself) representing some dreadful
disease, from which the bystanders recoiled in horror and amazement.
With all this drollery Lane kept himself well out of mischief,
and was moreover, in days when young and old were more or less
inclined to be topers, a strictly temperate man.</p>

<p>But Lane&rsquo;s talents were not confined to comic etching or designs
on wood. He was also an artist in oil and water colour. He
painted in oils <i>The Drunken Gardener</i>; <i>The Organ of Murder</i>, a
clumsy, nervous craniologist feeling his own head in doubt and
perplexity to ascertain whether the dreadful &ldquo;organ&rdquo; is developed
in himself; <i>An Hour before the Duel</i> (exhibited at the Institution in
Pall Mall). Other subjects of his pictures were: <i>The Poet reading
his Manuscript Play of Five Acts to a Friend</i>; <i>Too many Cooks Spoil
the Broth</i>; <i>The Nightmare</i>; <i>The Mathematician&rsquo;s Abstraction</i> (the
latter purchased by Lord Northwick). His most ambitious work
in oils (upwards of seventeen feet in length) was called <i>A Trip
to Ascot Races</i>. His last work, <i>The Enthusiast</i> (the first we
have mentioned), was exhibited at Somerset House at the time of
his death.</p>

<p>The fate of this clever young artist and satirist was both singular
and tragical.  It appears that on the 21st of February, 1828,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>88</span>
Theodore Lane, who then resided in Judd Street, Brunswick Square,
called upon his brother-in-law, Mr. Wakefield, a surgeon of Battle
Bridge, intending to proceed in the latter&rsquo;s gig to Hampstead, to join
a party of friends who had gone there to spend the day. Mr.
Wakefield having to visit a patient in Manchester Street, Gray&rsquo;s Inn
Lane, drove there with his brother-in-law, and this was the last time
he was seen alive. Close to the place was a horse bazaar, which
the artist appears to have entered by way of passing the time. The
horse and trap were there, but no trace of poor Lane; and on
search being made, his body was found lying lifeless at the foot
of the auctioneer&rsquo;s stand. He appears to have wandered into the
betting-room, and by some unexplained means or other fallen backwards
through an insufficiently protected skylight. The clever head
was battered so completely out of recognition that he was only
identified by his card-case. That Lane was a man of unusual
promise is shown by the fact that amongst the subscribers for the
benefit of the widow and children of the deceased, we find the
names of Sir Thomas Lawrence, president of the Royal Academy;
F. Chantrey, R.A.; George Westmacott; Cooper, the celebrated
animal painter; and Leahy, the painter of the celebrated picture of
&ldquo;Mary Stuart&rsquo;s Farewell to France.&rdquo; The remains of this ill-fated,
talented young fellow lie in the burial ground of old St. Pancras.</p>

into court riding backward on a black ram, and repeating the formula
mentioned in the design, the steward is bound to reinstate her. Without this explanation

<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>

<h5><i>THE CARICATURES OF ISAAC ROBERT CRUIKSHANK.</i></h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">It</span> was the misfortune of the brothers Cruikshank that they outlived
<span class="sn">The Brothers Cruikshank.</span>
their popularity: in the case of the younger brother, this result (as
we shall presently see) must be attributed in a certain measure to
his own fault; but as regards Robert, his efforts as a caricaturist
were destined to be eclipsed by the greater novelty and attractions of
<span class="cn">HB</span>, whilst a tendency to carelessness, and the absence of actual
genius, prevented him from attaining lasting celebrity in the line of
book illustration which George made so peculiarly his own. The
final result, however, was the same in both cases; and the brothers
might have said with truth, that, in suffering both to die poor and
neglected, the British public treated both with the strictest impartiality.
Here, however, the impartiality ended; for whilst over
two hundred articles have been penned in praise of the brilliant man
of genius, poor Robert Transit<a name="FnAnchor_50" href="#Footnote_50"><span class="sp">50</span></a> (a name strictly appropriate to his
memory) reposes in his nameless grave still unregarded and still
forgotten. Few writers indeed have wasted pen and ink about
Robert Cruikshank or his work: Robert William Buss, in his book
on &ldquo;English Graphic Satire&rdquo; (a work published for private circulation
only), devotes exactly a line and a half to his memory; his
friend, George Daniel, gives him a few kindly words <i>in memoriam</i>;
Professor Bates&rsquo;s essay on his brother George contains several
pages of valuable information in relation to some of his book
illustrations; whilst Mr. Hamilton presents us with a dozen specimens
of work of this kind which are nothing less than libels on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>90</span>
graphic powers. To the general public of to-day the name of Robert
Cruikshank is so little known, that comparatively few are cognizant
of the fact that he was one of the most popular and successful
graphic satirists of his time. It is the misfortune of the caricaturist
that his wares attain only a transitory popularity, whilst it is their
peculiarity that after he is dead their value is increased fourfold. It
is by no means uncommon for five and even seven shillings to be
demanded and obtained for one of the impressions of Robert&rsquo;s
plates, which in his lifetime could have been purchased at the cost
of a shilling. It is the design of this chapter to rescue the memory
of a clever artist from undeserved oblivion, and restore him to that
place in comic art which he once occupied, and which it seems to us
he deserved to fill not only on account of his own merits, but by
reason of being associated in illustrations of a different character
with such men as his brother George, Robert Seymour, Thomas
Rowlandson, John Leech, and other artists of genius and reputation.</p>

<p>Isaac Robert, or rather Robert Cruikshank (as he usually styled
himself), was born in 1790. He had as a boy acquired the groundwork
of his technical education as an artist and etcher under the
direction of old Isaac his father; but we personally have met with
little of his work prior to 1816, which is accounted for by the fact
that he followed for a short time a sea life in the service of the East
India Company, and after having thrown this up in favour of a
calling more congenial to his tastes, he devoted himself for some
years almost exclusively to miniature and portrait painting, by which
he earned not only a fair livelihood, but a certain amount of fashionable
patronage. Gradually, however (George tells us), he abandoned
this occupation, and took almost exclusively to designing and etching.
He occasionally alternated his work with water-colour drawing, in
which he is said to have greatly excelled. His works in this line are
extremely rare, for Robert had neither the means nor the patience
to wait for the tardy patronage to be commanded by a higher walk
in art; there was a demand for caricatures and comic etching in his
day, which afforded a present means of livelihood, and Robert&rsquo;s
water colours were executed more by way of relaxation than in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>91</span>
way of actual artistic pursuit. Among his early caricatures we may
mention a rough and coarsely coloured affair engraved by him after
the design of an amateur, published by Fores on the 28th of April,
1816, entitled, <i>The Mother&rsquo;s Girl Plucking a Crow, or German Flesh
and English Spirit</i>. The Princess Charlotte, as we have seen, had
an undoubted will of her own, and could, as we have also seen,
assert it when occasion demanded. Here she is presented to us at
the moment when a hideous German duenna, catching her in the act
of writing to her mother abroad, orders her at once to desist. The
princess, however, in plain terms, enforced with a clenched fist, gives
her clearly to understand that she fully intends to have her own way.
Another caricature, published by T. Sidebotham, in 1817, bearing
the title of <i>The Horse Marine and his Trumpeter in a Squall</i>, is
dedicated to the United Service Club.</p>

<p>Subjects for the pencil of a clever graphic satirist were not
<span class="sn">Strange French Fashions.</span>
wanting sixty years ago. France in those days set the fashion both
in male and female attire, and the strangest eccentricities had
marked the emancipation of that country from the thraldom of
the Terror. There were the <i>incroyables</i>, a set of young dandies who
affected royalist sympathies, and paraded the streets of Paris when
young Napoleon was yet a general in the service of the Directory.
They wore short-waisted coats with tails of preposterous length,
cocked hats of ponderous dimensions, green cravats, powdered hair
plaited and turned up with a comb, while on each side of the face
hung down two long curls called dogs&rsquo; ears (<i>oreilles de chien</i>). These
charming fellows carried twisted sticks of enormous size, as weapons
of offence and defence, and spoke in a peculiarly affected manner.<a name="FnAnchor_51" href="#Footnote_51"><span class="sp">51</span></a>
Some fourteen or fifteen years later on, when we had driven Joseph
Bonaparte and his brother&rsquo;s legions out of Spain, the fashions had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>92</span>
not improved. The biographer of Victor Hugo gives us the picture
of one Gilé, a Parisian dandy of that period, whose coat of olive
brown was cut in the shape of a fish&rsquo;s tail, and dotted all over with
metal buttons even to the shoulders. Young men who went to
moderate lengths in fashion were content to wear the waists of their
coats in the middle of their backs, but the waist of this Gilé intruded
on the nape of his neck. His hat was stuck on the right side of his
head, bringing into prominent notice on the left a thick tuft of hair
frizzed out with curling irons. His trousers were ornamented with
stripes which looked like bars of gold lace; they were pinched in at
the knees and wide at the bottom, giving his feet the appearance of
elephant&rsquo;s hoofs. Our own costume had been strange enough, in
all conscience; but when Napoleon&rsquo;s continental system had been
broken up after Leipzig, and a free market had been once more
opened out between this country and foreign nations, fashions more
strange and eccentric, if possible, found their way into England.
Thackeray, when writing his &ldquo;Vanity Fair,&rdquo; the scenes of which are
laid prior and subsequent to the battle of Waterloo, was fain to
confess that he had intended to depict his characters in their proper
costumes; &ldquo;but when he remembered the appearance of people in
those days, he had not the heart to disfigure his heroes and heroines
by costumes so hideous,&rdquo; and thenceforth he habited these men and
women of 1815 in the costume of the men and women of 1848.
George Cruikshank&rsquo;s &ldquo;Monstrosities&rdquo; are familiar to all acquainted
with his works; and his brother Robert and his contemporaries were
equally fond of ridiculing the preposterous fashions of their time.
We find in the year 1818 a pictorial satire by Robert, which shows
us a pair of <i>Dandies at Tea</i>, habited in the short-waisted, long-tailed
coats, tight breeches, terrific stocks, shirt collars, and top boots of
the period. &ldquo;My dear fellow, Mr. Sim,&rdquo; one of them, asks, &ldquo;is your
tea agreeable?&rdquo; to which the other answers, &ldquo;Charming, my dear
Lollena; where do you buy it?&rdquo; They are seated in an attic, which,
like that of the cobbler, serves &ldquo;for parlour and bedroom and all,&rdquo;
and the washing of the tenant hangs suspended on a line above
the heads of the interesting pair. We find another the same year,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>93</span>
entitled, <i>Dandies having a Treat</i>, wherein we are shown a couple of
eccentricities in a confectioner&rsquo;s shop; one of them, who eyes himself
with much complacency in the glass, has his back to us, and is
habited, <i>à la Gilé</i>, in a very tight coat, whose tail commences just
below its collar and narrows to a very fine point when it reaches its
extremity; short wide trousers terminate at the knees, at which
points they are met by a pair of Wellington boots. He entreats his
equally strangely dressed companion to pay no attention to the
uncomplimentary remarks of certain rude people who stand at the
door and seem strongly inclined to subject them to the discipline
of the pump. The pretty girl in attendance expresses to herself a
hope that &ldquo;the creatures will leave the shop,&rdquo; as she fears the exasperated
people will do some mischief. Another caricature of the
same year shows us <i>A Dandy Shoemaker in a Fright, or the Effects
of Tight-lacing</i>. In stooping to measure a lady&rsquo;s foot, the fellow&rsquo;s
stays have given way, and he evidently fears he shall tumble to
pieces. In another subject, Robert shows us a couple of <i>dandies
diving</i> into a countryman&rsquo;s pockets, in the neighbourhood of St.
James&rsquo;s Palace; others are entitled respectively, <i>A Dandy put to his
Last Chemisette, or Preparing for a Bond Street Lounge</i>; <i>A Dandy
Cock in Stays</i>; and <i>The Hen-pecked Dandy</i>. Besides those already
mentioned, I find four or five other coarse caricatures of Robert&rsquo;s,
published by Fores in 1818.</p>

<p>Robert Cruikshank was &ldquo;a man about town&rdquo; in those days, and
the &ldquo;dandies&rdquo; whom he and his fellow caricaturists satirized and
ridiculed were the sham &ldquo;Corinthians&rdquo; of his time. Apart from
the idea of caricature they must have been queer fellows&mdash;these men
with the large eye-glasses, squat broad-brimmed hats, huge cravats
and collars, cauliflower frills, tight coats, short bell-shaped trousers,
and well-spurred Wellington boots! In one of the satires of the
time (which I take to be Robert&rsquo;s) we see five of them preparing for
conquest in a hairdresser&rsquo;s shop; and the &ldquo;make up&rdquo; comprises, in
addition to the tremendous neckties, cauliflower frills, and top-boots
of the period, false calves and stays, a pair of which the Frenchman
hairdresser is lacing for one of his customers. Another of the party,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>94</span>
who has completed the upper part of his toilet, is so hampered with
the voluminous folds and stiffening of his cravat that he cannot
wriggle into his unmentionables. The caricaturists take us into the
garrets of these fellows, abodes of squalor and wretchedness, and
show us that beneath their exterior magnificence there is nothing, or
next to nothing. In a pair of rough anonymous satires&mdash;<i>The
Dandy Dressing at Home</i> and <i>The Dandy Dressed Abroad</i>&mdash;the
former shows us how the completed figure is built up. The absence
of a shirt is concealed by an amply frilled &ldquo;dickey,&rdquo; the dirty feet
protrude from the well-nigh footless stockings, the bare arms are
clothed at the extremities only by the cuffs, while a pair of huge seals
dangling from a ribbon guard form pendants to a latch-key instead
of a gold watch. The fellow&rsquo;s washing bill, which lies on the dressing-table
before him, comprises four items&mdash;all of them collars. On
the ground, side by side with the Wellington boots, which he himself
has just been cleaning, lie the open pages of &ldquo;The Beau&rsquo;s Stratagem.&rdquo;
In a sketch by the always coarse satirist Williams, two of these fellows
have been decoyed into an infamous house and drugged, and the
indignation of the bully and his female assistants is intense when they
find that their watches are not even pinchbeck, but only pincushions.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Corinthian Kates&rdquo; who figure in the satirical sketches of
this period are members of the <i>demi monde</i>. An excellent undated
sketch, signed &ldquo;J. L. M. fect.,&rdquo; entitled, <i>A Dandyess</i>, is divided into
two compartments. The first scene shows us the completed figure
(a most absurd one), and the second (which is laid in the lady&rsquo;s
garret) how the magnificent result has been attained. We find her
engaged in ironing her chemisette; over the fire are suspended her
stockings; on a stool near her stand her bottles of cosmetic and a
pot of rouge; on the floor her &ldquo;artificial hump&rdquo;; while her preposterous
bonnet and other articles of costume hang from different
articles of the scanty furniture.</p>

<p>Robert Cruikshank continues his attacks upon the fops in 1819.
<span class="sn">1819.</span>
In that year we meet with <i>A Dandy Sick</i>; <i>Dandies on their Hobbies</i>,
and <i>Female Lancers, or a Scene in St. James&rsquo;s Street</i>, chiefly remarkable
on account of the costume of the two men who figure therein.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>95</span>
Besides these we meet with a sort of pictorial allegory, entitled, <i>The
Mysterious Fair One, or the Royal Introduction to the Circassian
Beauty</i>, in which a foreign fair one is supposed to be introduced to
the Regent&rsquo;s harem. The veil being removed discovers to him the
well-known features of his neglected wife, from whom he recoils in
abhorrence. The bulky figure of the Regent who, under the influence
of copious port wine libations and general good living, had
grown preposterously fat, is admirably preserved by both the Cruikshanks.
The head and wig, tapering to an apex, remind one somewhat
of the French <i>poire</i> caricatures which disturbed the serenity of
Louis Philippe, and preceded the revolutionary period of 1848.</p>

<p>Other caricatures by Robert of this year (1819) are labelled respectively,
<i>The Political Champion turned Resurrection Man</i>, having reference
to Cobbett and &ldquo;Orator Hunt&rdquo;; <i>The Master of the Ordnance
Exercising his Hobby</i>; <i>A Steward at Sea in a Vain Tempest,
or Gaining the Point of Matrimony in Spite of Squalls</i>; <i>A New
Chancery Suit Removed to the Scotch Bar</i>; <i>The Ladies&rsquo; Accelerator</i> (two
women on hobbies); <i>Collegians at their Exercises, or Brazen Nose
Hobbies</i>; <i>A New Irish Jaunting Car</i>; and a satire entitled <i>Landing
at Dover and Overhauling the Baggage</i>, which would appear to refer
to some incivilities on the part of the custom house authorities to
the Persian ambassador and his suite. The subject was probably
only etched by the artist from the design of another, and is so grossly
treated that in spite of the admirable workmanship we cannot further
describe it. Besides these we have the now well-known <i>Going to
Hobby Fair</i> (the only caricature of Robert which would seem to be
known to those who have troubled themselves about him), and a
far better one of contemporary date, entitled, <i>Cruising on Land, or
Going to Hobby Horse Fair</i>.</p>

<p>Among the caricatures on the popular side in connection with the
<span class="sn">The Queen&rsquo;s Trial.</span>
queen&rsquo;s trial in 1820, we find one by Robert, entitled, <i>The Secret
Insult, or Bribery and Corruption Rejected</i>, which has reference to the
overtures which, as we have seen in the previous chapter, were made
to her by the ministers in the hope of avoiding, if possible, a public
exposure; and here Lord Liverpool is represented in the act of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>96</span>
offering to Her Majesty a purse. &ldquo;Abandon,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;your claim
to the throne, change your name and the livery, and retire to some
distant part of the earth, where you may never be seen or heard of
any more; and if £50,000 per annum will not satisfy you&mdash;what
will?&rdquo; To which the queen (who assumes an appearance of virtuous
indignation) replies, &ldquo;Nothing but a crown.&rdquo; Brougham turns his
back, saying, &ldquo;I turn my back on such dirty work as this,&rdquo; the
fact being, as we have seen, that he had really entered into negotiations
with the ministers on the queen&rsquo;s behalf, which she afterwards
angrily repudiated. The devil pats him on the back. &ldquo;Well done,
Broom,&rdquo; he says; &ldquo;you have done your business well.&rdquo; By the side
of the queen stands a figure, possibly meant for Alderman Wood,
carrying &ldquo;a shield for the innocent,&rdquo; and &ldquo;a sword for the guilty&rdquo;;
behind her in the distance is a ship, bearing the title of &ldquo;The
Wooden Walls of Old England.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In our last chapter we mentioned the estimation in which the
witnesses against Caroline of Brunswick were held by her sympathizers
and the general public, and Robert&rsquo;s political views naturally inclined
him to take the popular side. Those who saw them before
they were housed in Cotton Garden, describe them as swarthy, dirty
looking fellows, in scanty ragged jackets and greasy leathern caps;
at the bar of the House, however, they looked as respectable as fine
clothes and soap and water could make them. To this a caricature
of Robert&rsquo;s, entitled, <i>Preparing the Witnesses&mdash;a View in Cotton
Garden</i>, refers. Three dirty foreigners are being washed, with no
satisfactory result, in a bath labelled, &ldquo;Waters of Oblivion,&rdquo; &ldquo;Non
Mi Ricordo,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ministerial Washing Tub.&rdquo; One of the
operators (probably the Attorney-General, Sir Robert Gifford) remarks
that &ldquo;he never had such a dirty job in his life&rdquo;; seated
around are a number of equally dirty foreigners awaiting their turn.
On the same theme and in the same year we find <i>The Milan
Commission</i> (a very rough affair); <i>The Master Cook and his Black
Scullion composing a Royal Hash</i>; and a satire on the alderman, who,
in spite of his Carolinian and popular sympathies, figures therein
under the familiar title of &ldquo;Mother Wood.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>97</span></p>

<p>The following year gives us <i>All My Eye</i> (a skit upon Hone&rsquo;s
<span class="sn">1821.</span>
&ldquo;Eulogium on the Radical Press&rdquo;), representing a large eye, within
the pupil of which we see a printing press, whereon rests a portrait
of Queen Caroline; and also an admirable work, divided into two
compartments, bearing respectively the titles of <i>The Morning after
Marriage</i>, and <i>Coke upon Albemarle&mdash;not Coke upon Littleton</i>.</p>

<p>A somewhat ludicrous affair of honour took place in 1822. In
<span class="sn">1822.<br />Duel between the Dukes of Buckingham and Bedford.</span>
consequence of some words used by the Duke of Bedford in reference
to the Duke of Buckingham at the Bedfordshire county meeting,
a hostile meeting took place in Kensington Gardens between
the two noblemen on the 2nd of May. The seconds were Lord
Lynedock and Sir Watkin Williams Wynn. Both parties fired
together at a distance of twelve paces, but without effect; when the
Duke of Buckingham, observing that the Duke of Bedford fired into
the air, advanced to his grace, and remarking that for that reason
the affair could go no farther, said: &ldquo;My Lord Duke, you are the
last man I wish to quarrel with; but you must be aware that a
public man&rsquo;s life is not worth preserving unless with honour.&rdquo; The
Duke of Bedford replied, that &ldquo;upon his honour he meant no
personal offence to the Duke of Buckingham, nor to impute to him
any bad or corrupt motive whatever&rdquo;; and here this somewhat
absurd event terminated. Robert commemorates it in a caricature,
entitled, <i>A Shot from Buckingham to Bedford</i>, which cannot be said
to be complimentary to either of the principals, one of the walls
bearing the inscription in very large letters of &ldquo;Rubbish may be shot
here.&rdquo; Another admirable caricature of the year is entitled, <i>The
Treadmill, or Stage-struck Heroes, Blacklegs, and Cadgers stepping it
to the tune of Mill, Mill O!</i> a sort of general satire; card-sharpers,
decayed &ldquo;Corinthians,&rdquo; and other vagabonds, are undergoing a
course of hard labour upon the wheel, which was then a comparatively
new invention,<a name="FnAnchor_52" href="#Footnote_52"><span class="sp">52</span></a> their movements being accelerated by a gaoler
armed with a heavy whip, who bears some resemblance to, and is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>98</span>
probably intended for, the artist himself. A third excellent pictorial
satire of the same year bears the title of <i>Pope Mistaken</i>.</p>

<p>The year 1823 is remarkable for the interposition of the French
<span class="sn">1823.<br />French Interposition in Spain.</span>
Bourbon king into Spanish politics. The Spanish military, under
the influence of Riego and other officers, and encouraged by the
discontent of the middle classes, had revolted in 1820 against the
despotism of Ferdinand, and succeeded in establishing a constitution,
which, in spite of its imperfections, was preferable to the absolute
and irresponsible government of the Spanish monarchy. This state
of things was peculiarly distasteful to Louis XVIII., on account of
the evil example it afforded to his subjects; and, fortified by the
sympathy of the &ldquo;Holy Alliance&rdquo; (which may be shortly described
as a sort of trades union of sovereigns to resist all political changes
not originating with themselves), he determined to put it down. In
his speech to the chambers on the 28th of January, he announced
that, &ldquo;the infatuation with which the representations made at Madrid
had been rejected, left little hope of preserving peace. I have
ordered,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the recall of my minister; one hundred
thousand Frenchmen, commanded by a prince of my family [the
Duc d&rsquo;Angoulème]&mdash;by him whom my heart delights to call my
son&mdash;are ready to march, invoking the God of St. Louis, for the sake
of preserving the throne of Spain to a descendant of Henry the
Fourth, of saving that fine kingdom from its ruin, and of reconciling
it with Europe.&rdquo;  The real cause of interposition, however, is
indicated a few sentences afterwards: &ldquo;<i>Let Ferdinand the Seventh
be free to give to his people institutions which they cannot hold but from
him</i>, and which, by securing their tranquillity, would dissipate the
just inquietudes of France, [and] hostilities shall cease from that
moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We have neither time, space, nor inclination to relate the events of
this invasion; suffice it to say that, owing to the cowardice of the
Spaniards, it was a complete &ldquo;walk over&rdquo; for the French, who, in
five months after they had crossed the Bidassoa, had penetrated to
Cadiz, dispersed the Cortes, and restored the despotism of Ferdinand.</p>

<p>The contemplated crusade had aroused a certain amount of
sympathy in favour of Spain in England, but it did not go farther
than the giving of a splendid entertainment to the Spanish and
Portuguese ambassadors at the London Tavern on the 7th of March,
under the presidentship of Lord William Bentinck. The truth was
that John Bull had not forgotten the ungrateful and cowardly conduct
of the Spaniards when we drove the French out of their country
in Napoleon&rsquo;s time; added to which England was saddled with a
heavy national debt, which made us still less inclined to intermeddle
with the affairs of our neighbours. Robert Cruikshank
produced a caricature in reference to our position, called, <i>John Bull
Flourishing in an Attitude of Strict Neutrality</i>, wherein he shows us
Spain in the act of imploring his assistance, which, however, poor
John is in no position to render, seeing that he wants help himself,
being placed in the stocks and heavily burdened with the weight of
&ldquo;last war&rsquo;s taxes.&rdquo; In the distance appears fat Louis, mounted on a
cannon, driven by the Pope, Russia, Austria, and Prussia, in allusion,
of course, to the &ldquo;Holy Alliance&rdquo; (the three latter powers had
recalled their ambassadors from Madrid on the 5th of January),
while the devil condescends to lend his assistance by pushing on
behind. This caricature is probably the best that Robert ever
designed. Another satire on the same subject bears the title of
<i>King Gourmand XVIII. and Prince Posterior in a Fright</i>.</p>

<p>One of Robert&rsquo;s satires of this year, entitled <i>The Golden Football</i>,
<span class="sn">Hughes Ball.</span>
has obvious reference to Hughes Ball, known at Eton by his surname
of Hughes only, but who took the further name of <i>Ball</i> on coming
into a fortune of forty thousand a year left him by his uncle, Admiral
Sir Alexander Ball, and thenceforth received his appropriate nickname
of the &ldquo;Golden Ball.&rdquo; He was considered a great catch by
all the mothers in London; but, notwithstanding his money, was
unfortunate in love, being jilted by Lady Jane Paget, rejected by
Miss Floyd (afterwards the wife of Sir Robert Peel), and then by
Lady Caroline Churchill. The young ladies hearing of his numerous
disappointments, were disinclined to encourage a man so proverbially
unfortunate. By way, perhaps, of revenge, Hughes Ball this year ran
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>100</span>
off with and married Mademoiselle Mercandotti, <i>première danseuse</i>
at His Majesty&rsquo;s Theatre, a beautiful girl of sixteen, reported in the
scandal of the day to be a natural daughter of the Earl of Fife. The
incident of Lady Jane Paget we have mentioned is thus referred
to by Charles Molloy Westmacott, the Ishmael of the press of his
day, in the <i>English Spy</i>, a work which, as we shall presently see, was
also illustrated by the artist:&mdash;</p>

<p>Other of Robert&rsquo;s satires of the same year bear the title of <i>The
Commons</i> versus <i>the Crown of Martyrdom, or King Abraham&rsquo;s
Coronation Deferred</i>; and <i>A View in Cumberland</i>, that is the royal
duke of that name&mdash;a most unpopular personage, and of course
proportionately fertile subject of satire in his time.</p>

<p>Among Robert&rsquo;s pictorial satires of 1824, I find one entitled
<span class="sn">1824.<br />The Tenth Hussars.</span>
<i>Arrogance or <span class="correction" title="changed from Nonchalence">Nonchalance</span> of the Tenth Reported</i>,&mdash;the &ldquo;tenth&rdquo; here
referred to being the Tenth Hussars. This distinguished regiment
set the pencils of the Brothers Cruikshank and their fellow caricaturists
in motion at this period, and I find an amazing number of
caricatures of the date of 1824, of which they form the subject.
The officers would seem to have acquired considerable unpopularity
by the exclusive airs they gave themselves in society, refusing to
dance, declining introductions at public and private balls, and otherwise
assuming an arrogant and exclusive tone which made them
supremely ridiculous. So far did they carry these absurdities, that
they even declined to associate with an officer of their own regiment
unless he previously submitted to them the particulars of his birth,
parentage, and education, and general claim to be admitted to the
privilege of their august society. A certain Mr. Battier, who seems
to have been ignorant of the peculiar arrangement they had established
in opposition to the rules and policy of the service, had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>101</span>
obtained from the Duke of York a cornetcy in the regiment, but not
having submitted himself to the examination referred to, or possibly
not answering to the exclusive requirements of the regiment, was
forthwith sent to Coventry by his courteous brother officers. The
result, of course, was that the unlucky gentleman, finding no one to
speak to him, was forced to retire on half pay, which he was
unfortunate enough afterwards to forfeit by not unnaturally sending
a challenge to the colonel of the regiment.<a name="FnAnchor_53" href="#Footnote_53"><span class="sp">53</span></a></p>

<p>Maria Foote at this time was one of the most popular actresses
<span class="sn">Miss Foote.</span>
in London. Some years before she had come on a starring tour
to Cheltenham, a town much affected by the notorious Colonel
Berkeley, who being passionately devoted to the stage, and possessed
moreover of some histrionic ability, gallantly offered to perform for
her benefit. The colonel was notorious for his gallantries; under
a promise of marriage&mdash;which could not then, he said, be carried
into effect, inasmuch as he was then petitioning the Crown to grant
him the dormant peerage, which a marriage with an actress could
not fail to prejudice&mdash;he succeeded in accomplishing her seduction,
and she continued to live under his &ldquo;protection&rdquo; till, on the birth
of her second child, she arrived at the true conviction that he never
had any intention of fulfilling his promise. There was at this time
a silly fellow about town, Mr. Joseph Hayne, of Burderop Park,
Wiltshire, familiarly known (in reference to the colour of his coat)
as &ldquo;Pea Green Hayne,&rdquo; who fell in love with and proposed to the
fascinating actress. There was no attempt at concealment on her
part: it was stated at the trial which followed that she herself
wished to communicate to him the circumstance of her connexion
with Colonel Berkeley, when this gallant gentleman saved her the
trouble of doing so, and one night when they were in the pit of
the opera together, took the characteristic course of making Hayne
acquainted with the liaison, and the fact that it still existed. Hayne
immediately broke off the engagement; but soon afterwards not
only renewed it, but fixed the day of marriage. Again he broke it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>102</span>
off, again yielded to the fascinations of his enslaver, and this time
not only was the wedding-day fixed and the license obtained, but
&ldquo;Pea Green Hayne&rdquo; took a solemn vow that nothing should separate
him from the object of his affections. Believing that all was safe,
Miss Foote now threw up her engagement and disposed of
her theatrical wardrobe, but the weak-minded, vacillating creature,
who could not summon up resolution either to have or to leave
her, let matters go on to the very day, and again failed to put in
an appearance. Some preliminary letters having passed between
the parties, Maria then issued a writ, and recovered £3,000 damages
in the action which followed. The plaintiff, who seven years afterwards
became Countess of Harrington, died in 1867.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pea Green&rdquo; Hayne was also known as the &ldquo;Silver Ball,&rdquo; in
allusion to his large income, which was smaller however than that
enjoyed by his friend and contemporary, Hughes Ball. After his
exposure in the action Foote <i>v.</i> Hayne, he received the far more
appropriate nickname of &ldquo;Foote-Ball.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The opportunity of course was improved by the caricaturists, and
Robert&rsquo;s contributions on the subject (1824 and 1825) are labelled
respectively, <i>Miss Foote in the King&rsquo;s Bench Battery</i>; <i>Miss Foote
putting her Foot in it</i>; and <i>A Foot on the Stage and Asses in the Pit,
or a New Year&rsquo;s Piece for 1825</i>. Other pictorial satires of Robert&rsquo;s
bearing the date of 1824, are: <i>A Civic Louse in the State Bed</i>; <i>A
Cut at the City Cauliflower</i>; <i>The Corinthian Auctioneer</i>; two very
coarse but well drawn subjects&mdash;<i>Moments of Prattle and Pleasure</i>
and <i>Moments of Parting with Treasure</i>; and an exquisitely drawn
sketch bearing the title of <i>Madame Catalani and the Bishop of Limbrig</i>,
having reference to some musical festival at Cambridge, the
point of which has been lost, but which is remarkable for the
admirable likeness of the popular singer.</p>

<p>The conduct of Colonel Berkeley in reference to the case Foote
<span class="sn">1825.</span>
<i>v.</i> Hayne, called forth, as might have been expected, some severe
strictures from the press, and in particular Mr. Judge, editor of the
<i>Cheltenham Journal</i>, which place the colonel honoured with his
patronage and society, had occasionally indulged in animadversions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>103</span>
on his conduct. In one of the numbers of his paper an article
appeared, in which some satirical observations were made with
reference to the annual &ldquo;Berkeley Hunt&rdquo; ball. On the afternoon
of that day Colonel Berkeley accompanied, by two of his friends,
called at Mr. Judge&rsquo;s residence, and being invited to walk in, the
colonel asked Mr. Judge if he would name the author of the papers
which had appeared in the <i>Journal</i>. Mr. Judge said he did not
know whom he had the honour of addressing, and on learning who
he was, proposed that he should call at the office of the paper,
&ldquo;where he would give him every satisfaction.&rdquo; Colonel Berkeley
replied, &ldquo;No, sir! Now, sir! Now, sir!&rdquo; and without further notice
commenced a cowardly attack on the unarmed man by beating him
<i>over the head</i> and face with the butt-end of a heavy hunting whip.
To make the dastardly affair more dastardly if possible, one of the
two fellows with him stood at the door, and the other near the fire
place, so as to prevent Judge from seizing any weapon or calling
any one to his assistance. For this ruffianly assault, which placed
poor Judge for some time in considerable danger of his life, he
subsequently recovered substantial damages against his cowardly
antagonist. The Colonel got a far worse dressing from Robert
Cruikshank who, in a severe contemporary skit, named (in allusion
to the colonel&rsquo;s notorious illegitimacy) <i>Colonel Fitz Bastard</i>, depicted
him and his friends in the act of assaulting the editor of the
<i>Cheltenham Journal</i>.</p>

<p>The artist&rsquo;s tastes and sympathies threw him much in the society
<span class="sn">Edmund Kean.</span>
of actors. The following year his thoroughly Bohemian friend,
Edmund Kean, was mulcted in £800 damages, in consequence of
a disgraceful liaison with the wife of Alderman Cox; and while
audiences thronged the one theatre to testify their sympathy for a
favourite and popular actress, they crowded the other to howl and
hiss at the thoroughly disreputable and disgraced tragedian. The
episode is referred to by the artist in three of his contemporary
caricatures, labelled respectively, <i>Wolves Triumphant, or a Fig for
Public Opinion</i>; <i>A Scene from the Pantomime of Cock-a-Doodle-Doo,
lately performed at Drury Lane with unbounded applause</i>; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>104</span>
the <i>Hostile Press, or Shakespeare in Danger</i>, all of which contain
perhaps the best theatrical portraits of the popular tragedian which
are extant.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott also figures in one of Robert&rsquo;s satires of this year
entitled, <i>The Great Unknown lately discovered in Ireland</i>, wherein he
is represented in Highland costume, with the Waverley novels on his
head, holding by the hand a small figure in hussar uniform, intended
for his son, Captain Scott of the 18th hussars, who this year had
married Miss Jobson, of Lochore. The pair after their marriage
returned to Ireland, where the captain was quartered, and where he
and his wife were visited by Sir Walter in August of this year.
Although the fact was pretty well known, the authorship of the
novels was not avowed until February of the following year, when
with Sir Walter&rsquo;s consent it was proclaimed by Lord Meadowbank
at a theatrical dinner on the 27th of February.</p>

<p>A very curious personage makes his appearance in Robert&rsquo;s
<span class="sn">The Living Skeleton.</span>
sketches of this year, who would seem at first sight to be the most
outrageously caricatured of any of his subjects, and yet this in truth
is not the case. This person was the celebrated Claude Ambroise
Seurat, &ldquo;the living skeleton,&rdquo; who was exhibited at the Chinese
saloon in Pall Mall, and whose portrait from three different points of
view was taken by Robert Cruikshank, and afterwards appeared in
the first volume of Hone&rsquo;s &ldquo;Every-day Book,&rdquo; where a full account
of this very singular personage will be found. The repulsive object,
who (with the exception of his face) presented all the appearance of
an attenuated skeleton, was exhibited in a state of complete nudity
with the exception of a fringe of silk about his middle, from which
(out of two holes cut for the purpose) protruded his dreadful hip
bones. Seurat, as might have been expected, forms the subject of
numerous contemporary caricatures; and in one of these, by way of
comical contrast, the worthy but corpulent alderman, Sir William
Curtis, distinguished by a similar scantiness of attire, figures with the
living skeleton in a lively <i>pas de deux</i>. William Heath, in another of
contemporary date, represents the fat alderman standing on a map
of England, and Seurat on a map of France. Says Sir William: &ldquo;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>105</span>
say, friend, did you ever eat turtle soup?&rdquo; to which Claude Ambroise
replies, &ldquo;No, sare; but I did eat de soupe maigre.&rdquo; In another
(also I think by the same artist), labelled, <i>Foreign Rivals for British
Patronage</i>, the living skeleton and a favourite male Italian singer of
the time are represented in the act of preparing for mortal combat.<a name="FnAnchor_54" href="#Footnote_54"><span class="sp">54</span></a></p>

<p>A number of the caricatures of 1825 (and among them many by
Robert) are singularly illustrative of the morals of the time. About
this year had been published a work professing to contain the
memoirs of an apt disciple of Mrs. Mary Anne Clarke, which was
made the vehicle of extorting money. The <i>modus operandi</i> appears
to have been as follows. In the month of March, 1825, a well-known
M.P. of that day received a letter from this creature in the
following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="rt">&ldquo;<span class="sc">No. 111, Rue du Faubourg St. Honoré</span>,</p>
<p class="rt" style="padding-right: 5em;"><span class="sc">à Paris.</span></p>

<p>Sir,&mdash;People are buying themselves so fast out of my book,
...<a name="FnAnchor_55" href="#Footnote_55"><span class="sp">55</span></a> that I have no time to attend to them; should be sorry
not to give each <i>a chance</i>, if they <i>chuse to be out</i>. You are quizzed
most <i>unmercifully</i>. Two noble dukes have lately taken my word,
and I have never named them. I am sure &mdash;&mdash; would say you
might trust me never to publish, or <i>cause</i> to be published, aught
about you, if you like to forward £200 directly to me, else it will be
too late, as the last volume, in which you <i>shine</i>, will be the property
of the editor, and in his hands. Lord &mdash;&mdash; says he will answer for
aught I agree to; so will my husband. Do <i>just as you like</i>&mdash;consult
only yourself. I get as much by a small <i>book</i> as you will give me
for taking you out, or more. I attack no poor men, because they
cannot help themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Adieu. Mind, I have no time to write again, as what with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>106</span>
writing books, and then altering them for those who <i>buy out</i>, I am
done up&mdash;<i>frappé en mort</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trust to bag<a name="FnAnchor_56" href="#Footnote_56"><span class="sp">56</span></a> with your answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That this extraordinary communication was no idle threat was
proved by the fact that a respectable statuary, carrying on business
in Piccadilly, who had refused to pay <i>black-mail</i>, brought an action
for libel in the King&rsquo;s Bench on the 1st of July against a man
named Stockdale, publisher of the infamous production referred to,
and recovered £300 damages. The same year Popple, the printer,
brought his action against this fellow; but Mr. Justice Best directed
him to be nonsuited, on the ground that he was not entitled to
remuneration for printing a work of such a character.</p>

<p>The Catholic Relief Bill, which was thrown out this year, is the
subject of several of Robert&rsquo;s satires, bearing the titles of <i>John Bull
versus Pope Bull</i>; <i>Defenders of the Faith</i>; <i>The Hare Presumptuous,
or a Catholic Game Trap</i>; <i>A Political Shaver, or the Crown in
Danger</i>. <i>The Catholic Association, or Paddy Coming it too Strong</i>,
has reference to Mr. Goulburn&rsquo;s motion to suppress the Catholic
Association of Ireland, which was carried by 278 to 123, and the
third reading by a majority of 130. The language used by Mr.
O&rsquo;Connell on the occasion was so strong that an indictment was
subsequently preferred against him, which, however, was thrown out
by the grand jury. <i>Matheworama</i> for 1825 depicts that celebrated
impersonator in thirteen of his characters. <i>Duelling</i> deserves particular
mention by reason of the admirably designed landscape and
figures. It represents one of the principals (who looks very far from
comfortable) waiting, with his second and a doctor, the advent of
the other parties. <i>The Bubble Burst, or the Ghost of an old Act of
Parliament</i>, has reference to the speculation mania of 1825. Others
of his satires for the year are labelled respectively, <i>Frank and Free,
or Clerical Characters in 1825</i>; <i>A Beau Clerk for a Banking Concern</i>;
<i>The Flat Catcher and the Rat Catcher</i>; and <i>A Pair of
Spectacles, or the London Stage in 1824-5</i>, which, although unsigned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>107</span>
and bearing no initials, I have no hesitation in assigning to Robert
Cruikshank.</p>

<p>I am unable to indicate the dates of the following: <i>Football</i>, very
clever, and probably earlier than any of those already mentioned;
<i>Waltzing</i>, &ldquo;dedicated with propriety to the lord chamberlain,&rdquo; a
very coarse and severe satire upon the immoralities of the Prince
Regent. Besides those we have already mentioned, we have others
with which the volume miscalled &ldquo;Cruikshankiana&rdquo; (so often republished)
has made the general public probably more familiar, such
as the <i>Monstrosities of 1827</i>; <i>A Dandy Fainting, or an Exquisite in
Fits</i>; <i>The Broom Sold</i> (Lord Brougham); <i>Household Troops</i> (a skit
on domestic servants); and <i>A Tea-party, or English Manners and
French Politeness</i>, all of which may be dismissed with the remark that
they are the worst specimens of Robert&rsquo;s work which could probably
have been selected.</p>

<p>With the year 1825, our record of Isaac Robert Cruikshank&rsquo;s
<span class="sn">Scarcity of Robert&rsquo;s Satires.</span>
caricature work somewhat abruptly terminates. We cannot assert
that after that date it wholly ceased, but, inasmuch as we have
selected those we have named from a mass of some of the rarest
pictorial satires published between the years 1800 and 1830, I think
we are fairly justified in assuming that after this period his contributions
to this branch of comic art became fewer. If this be the fact,
it confirms the conclusion at which we have arrived, that at this time
caricature had begun its somewhat hasty decline. Those I have
named comprise over seventy examples; and their value, which is
great on account of their scarcity, will be increased by the possibility
that in the conception and execution of some of them the mind and
hand of Robert might have been assisted by those of the more
celebrated brother. &ldquo;When my dear brother Robert,&rdquo; says George
in writing to the compiler of the famous catalogue of his own works,
&ldquo;when my dear brother Robert (who in his latter days omitted the
Isaac) left off portrait painting, and took almost entirely to designing
and etching, I assisted him at first to a great extent in some of his
drawings on wood and his etchings.&rdquo; If this be the case, it is at
least possible that he lent the assistance of his cunning hand and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>108</span>
original fancy to the preparation of some of these contributions to
pictorial satire. It appears to us, therefore, that a just idea of
George&rsquo;s own work as an artist can scarcely be arrived at (especially
his share of the famous &ldquo;Life in London&rdquo;) until we have first considered
the early work of himself and his brother Robert as graphic
satirists and caricaturists. They were closely associated in artistic
work during their early career; and it was not until both had given
up social and political satire, and devoted themselves to the then
comparatively new field of book illustration and etching on copper,
that the superiority, originality, and genius of the younger brother
became so manifest and incontrovertible.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<h5><i>ROBERT CRUIKSHANK</i> (<i>Continued</i>).</h5>

<h5><i>&ldquo;LIFE IN LONDON&rdquo; AND OTHER BOOK WORK.</i></h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">In</span> perusing various articles on George Cruikshank in which reference
is made to the &ldquo;Life in London,&rdquo; we have been struck with the almost
utter absence of Robert Cruikshank&rsquo;s name; further than this, it
seems to have been the almost universal impression that it was his
association with George on this memorable book which secured such
reputation as Robert himself enjoyed. So far, however, was this from
being the case, that not only was Robert, in 1821, a caricaturist and
satirist of acknowledged reputation, but he was believed at this
very time by the general public to be the cleverer artist of the two.
Robert, indeed, has been treated with curious injustice in relation to
this famous book, which owes its very existence (as we shall presently
see) to him alone. While according to George (as in effect they do)
the whole merit of the performance, many of the writers of the
articles referred to acknowledge that they find it impossible to
assign to him his share of the illustrations; and that difficulty will be
largely increased to any one who has studied Robert Cruikshank&rsquo;s
caricature work. The fact is that few of these famous plates will bear
comparison with the best of Robert&rsquo;s pictorial satires; while the
kindred book of the &ldquo;English Spy,&rdquo; which was illustrated (with the
exception of one plate) by Robert alone, contains designs quite equal
to those which adorn the &ldquo;Life in London.&rdquo; When it is admitted
that Robert executed three parts of these illustrations, while those
who have written upon him say that they are unable to identify
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>110</span>
George&rsquo;s share of the work,<a name="FnAnchor_57" href="#Footnote_57"><span class="sp">57</span></a> it seems unjust (to say the least of it)
that the credit of the <i>whole</i> performance should be assigned to him
alone. Let us be just to Robert, even though his merit as a draughtsman
has been lost sight of in the fame which the younger brother
achieved by virtue of his greater genius.</p>

<p>The reader need not be told&mdash;and we are not going to tell him
<span class="sn">Popularity of &ldquo;Life in London.&rdquo;</span>
what he knows already&mdash;that the &ldquo;Life&rdquo; was dramatized by four
writers for different theatrical houses. The most successful version
was the one produced at the Adelphi, previously known as the <i>Sans
Pareil</i> theatre. The first season of this house, which Messrs Jones
and Rodwell had recently purchased for £25,000, was only moderately
successful; but the fortune of the second was made by &ldquo;Tom
and Jerry.&rdquo; Night after night immediately after the opening of the
doors, the theatre was crowded to the very ceiling; the rush was
tremendous. By three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon of every day the
pavement of the Strand had become impassable, and the dense mass
which occupied it had extended by six o&rsquo;clock far across the roadway.
Peers and provincials, dukes and dustmen, all grades and
classes of people swelled the tide which night after night rolled its
wave up the passage of the Adelphi. It was a compact wedge; on
it moved, slowly, laboriously, amid the shouts and shrieks, the justling
and jostling of the crowd which composed it, leavened by the
intermixture of numbers of the swell mob, who plied their vocation
with indefatigable industry and impunity. Nevertheless, the reader
will be surprised to learn (and it is probably little known) that in
spite of this amazing popularity, the first night of &ldquo;Tom and Jerry&rdquo;
met with such unexpected opposition that Mr. Rodwell declared it
should never be played again. Luckily for himself and his partner
he was induced to reconsider this decision. The tide was taken at
the flood, and it led&mdash;as the poet assures us that it will lead when so
taken&mdash;to an assured fortune.</p>

<p class="ar">[<i>Face p. 110.</i></p></td></tr></table></div>

<p>One night a stranger entered the private box of the Duke of York
at the Adelphi, and seated himself immediately behind his Royal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>111</span>
Highness, who took but little notice of the intruder. The mysterious
stranger had been brought in and was fetched by a plain green
chariot; and the few that saw him said that he was a portly gentleman,
wrapped in a long great coat and muffled up to the eyes.
Keeping himself well behind his Royal Highness, the portly stranger
took a deep but unostentatious interest in the performance. In his
Haroun al-Raschid character he had been present, with his friend
Lord Coleraine (then Major George Hanger), at some of the actual
scenes represented; and in particular, by virtue of the fact of his wearing
&ldquo;a clean shirt,&rdquo; had been called upon by the ragged chairman at
a convivial meeting of the &ldquo;Cadgers&rdquo; to favour them with a song,
which had been sung for him by his friend and proxy the Major.
The mysterious stranger in fact, as the reader has already guessed,
was his gracious Majesty King George the Fourth, and his visit
<i>incognito</i> having been made by previous notice and arrangement, the
passages were kept as clear of the general public as possible.</p>

<p>The scenery of the Adelphi version was superintended by Robert
Cruikshank himself. &ldquo;Tom and Jerry&rdquo; brought a strange mixture
of visitors to attend the rehearsals. Corinthians (men of fashion)&mdash;members
of the turf and the prize ring, who found a common
medium of conversation in the sporting slang which Mr. Egan has
made so familiar to us. Naturally there was a mixture. Tom Cribb,
whom the Cruikshanks had temporarily elevated into the position of
a hero, was indispensable; and the silver cup which figures in
Robert&rsquo;s sketch was every night made use of in the scene depicting
the champion&rsquo;s pot-house sanctum. Among the frequenters at these
rehearsals was a quiet man of unusually unobtrusive deportment and
conversation,&mdash;this man was Thurtell, the cold-blooded murderer of
Mr. Weare.</p>

<p>Since the days of the &ldquo;Beggars&rsquo; Opera,&rdquo; a success equal to that
which attended the &ldquo;Life in London,&rdquo; and its several dramatized
versions by Barrymore, Charles Dibdin, Moncrieff, and Pierce Egan,
had been unknown. The exhausted exchequers of four or five
theatres were replenished; and as in the days of the &ldquo;Beggars&rsquo;
Opera&rdquo; the favourite songs of that piece were transferred to the ladies&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>112</span>
fans, and highwaymen and abandoned women became the heroes
and heroines of the hour, so, in like manner, the Cruikshanks&rsquo; designs
were now transferred to tea-trays, snuff-boxes, pocket-handkerchiefs,
screens, and ladies&rsquo; fans, and the popular favourites of 1821 and 1822
were &ldquo;Corinthian Tom,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jerry Hawthorn,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bob Logic,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bob
the dustman,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Corinthian Kate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The success of &ldquo;Life in London&rdquo; was not regarded with equal
satisfaction by all classes of the community; the serious world
was horribly scandalized. Zealous, honest, fervid, and terribly in
earnest, these good folks, in their ignorance of the world and of
human nature, only added to the mischief which it was their honest
wish to abate. They proclaimed the immorality of the drama; denounced
&ldquo;Tom and Jerry&rdquo; from the pulpit; and besieged the doors
of the play houses with a perfect army of tract droppers. Anything
more injudicious, anything less calculated to achieve the end which
these good people had in view, I can scarcely imagine; for it is a
well-known fact that the best method of making a book or a play a
&ldquo;commercial success,&rdquo; in England, is to throw doubts on its moral
tendency.<a name="FnAnchor_58" href="#Footnote_58"><span class="sp">58</span></a> The more respectable portion of the press did better
service to their cause by showing that, in spite of their popularity,
&ldquo;Tom and Jerry&rdquo; were doing mischief, and that the theatres lent their
aid to disseminate the evil, by nightly regaling the female part of
society &ldquo;with vivid representations of the blackest sinks of iniquity
to be found in the metropolis.&rdquo; Called on to defend his drama,
Moncrieff, strange to say, proved himself no wiser than his assailants.
All he could allege in its behalf was that &ldquo;the obnoxious scenes of
life were only shown that they might be avoided; the danger of
mixing in them was strikingly exemplified; and every incident tended
to prove&rdquo;&mdash;what? why,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>that happiness was only to be found in
the domestic circle</i>&rdquo;! This was special pleading with a vengeance!
Of course all that the theatres really cared to do was to fill their
exhausted exchequers; while as for Bohemian Robert and his friend
Egan, the idea of making the &ldquo;Life in London&rdquo; a moral lesson never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>113</span>
once entered their heads. The artist however was shrewd enough to
take note of the observation for future use; and seven years later on,
when he and Egan produced their &ldquo;Finish to the Adventures of
Tom, Jerry, and Logic in their Pursuits through Life in and out
of London,&rdquo; endeavoured to profit by the storm which had been
raised by the good people of 1821, by tagging a clumsy moral to the
sequel.</p>

<p>By this time, however, the excitement which had attended the
original work had evaporated; by this time, too, the public had learnt
to discriminate between the pencils of the brothers Cruikshank; and
the &ldquo;Finish,&rdquo; as compared with the original &ldquo;Life,&rdquo; fell comparatively
flat. It made however some sort of sensation in its day, but has
become not only a scarce book, but one that is little sought after.
The genius and reputation of George and the pen of Thackeray
have kept alive the popularity of the &ldquo;Life,&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_59" href="#Footnote_59"><span class="sp">59</span></a> while the &ldquo;Finish&rdquo;&mdash;left
to the unaided but clever hand of Robert&mdash;has like himself
been almost forgotten.</p>

<p>And yet it scarcely merits this fate. It contains thirty-six etchings
by Robert Cruikshank, some of them of singular merit. Among
them may be mentioned, <i>The Duchess of Dogood</i>; <i>Splendid Jim</i>;
<i>Logic Visiting his Old Acquaintance on Board the Fleet</i>; <i>Corinthian
Kate in the Last Stage of Consumption, Disease, and Inebriety</i>; and if
not the production of a genius, the hand of an artist of singular merit,
ability, and power is manifest in the etchings entitled, <i>The Hounds at
a Standstill</i>; <i>Logic&rsquo;s Upper Storey</i>; and <i>The End of Corinthian Kate</i>.</p>

<p>Although modestly claiming for himself the merits of this book,
<span class="sn">Pierce Egan.</span>
Pierce Egan stands in relation to it in the position of a showman, and
nothing more. He is not even entitled to the credit of being the
originator,&mdash;for the originator and suggestor was Robert Cruikshank,
who informs us of the fact (after his own characteristic fashion) by
way of footnote to his frontispiece to the &ldquo;Finish.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_60" href="#Footnote_60"><span class="sp">60</span></a> But Egan is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>114</span>
undoubtedly a clever showman; if he displays rather more vulgarity
than we altogether like, we must not forget the audience to whom he
addresses himself, and for whom indeed his show is specially intended.
We cannot admit that the popularity of this book was <i>entirely</i> due to
the merit of the artists whose canvas he elucidates and (after his own
fashion) explains. In common fairness some credit should be <span class="correction" title="amended from conceeded">conceded</span>
to Egan himself. Of literary talents he had not a particle;
and if he lacked taste and refinement, it may at least be urged in his
behalf that the age was not one of refinement, and that sixty years
ago we had scarcely emancipated ourselves from the barbarism and
vulgarity some remnants of which had descended to us from the
time of George the Second. The bent of his taste and the scope of
his abilities may be guessed from the fact that his &ldquo;account of the
trial of John Thurtell, the murderer,&rdquo; passed into at least <i>thirteen</i>
editions. A man of this stamp could scarcely be expected to
recognise the true value of the work with which he had the honour
to be associated; he never looked beyond his patrons of the day,
and as a natural consequence posterity has troubled itself little about
him. You will search the biographical dictionaries in vain for any
account of him;<a name="FnAnchor_61" href="#Footnote_61"><span class="sp">61</span></a> and this oblivion he scarcely deserves, for not only
was he one of the most popular men of sixty years ago, but he would
scarcely have attained that position without a fair share of merit.
He was not deficient in energy, and his talent is shown by the fact
that he understood and (in a measure) led the taste of his day,
taking advantage of his knowledge to raise himself to a position
unattainable had such taste been of a more elevated and refined
character. His descriptive powers (such as they were) were sufficient
to procure him the post of recorder of the &ldquo;Doings of the Ring&rdquo; on
the staff of the <i>Weekly Dispatch</i>, which post he occupied at the time
he officiated as literary showman to &ldquo;Tom and Jerry.&rdquo; He had however
tried many trades,&mdash;had been in turn a compositor, bookseller,
sporting writer, newspaper reporter, and even secretary to an Irish
theatrical manager. The success of &ldquo;Life in London,&rdquo; which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>115</span>
arrogated to himself, raised up a crop of enemies as well as friends,
and he soon afterwards received his <i>congé</i> from the proprietors of the
<i>Dispatch</i>. Pierce Egan, however, was not a man to be daunted by any
such discouragement; he was found equal to the occasion, meeting
his employers&rsquo; <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> by starting a sporting paper of his own, to
which he gave the name of his successful book,&mdash;<i>Pierce Egan&rsquo;s
Life in London, and Sporting Guide</i>. This counter movement proved
the germ of a great enterprise. Probably his venture was no very
great success; it ran only for three years from its commencement on
the 1st of February, 1824. On the 28th of October, 1827, <i>Egan&rsquo;s
Life in London</i> was sold by auction to a Mr. Bell, and thenceforth
assumed its well known and now time honoured title of <i>Bell&rsquo;s Life
in London</i>.</p>

<p>Another friend of the artist was Charles Molloy Westmacott, as he
<span class="sn">Charles Molloy Westmacott.</span>
called himself, but who is supposed to have been&mdash;<i>filius nullius</i> or
<i>filius populi</i>&mdash;the child of Mrs. Molloy, a pretty widow who kept a
tavern at Kensington. Westmacott was one of a class of writers
who not only existed but thrived in the early part of our century by
the levying of literary black-mail. The <i>modus operandi</i> (as given by
Mr. William Bates, from whom we derive our information respecting
this man) appears to have been as follows: &ldquo;Sometimes a vague
rumour or hint of scandal, accompanied perchance by a suggestive
newspaper paragraph, was conveyed to one or more of the parties
implicated, with a threat of <span class="correction" title="amended from furthur">further</span> inquiry into its truth, and a full
exposure of the circumstances which excited the sender&rsquo;s virtuous
indignation. This, if the selected victim was a man of nervous,
timid temperament, often produced the desired effect; and although
possibly entirely innocent of the allegation, he preferred to purchase
silence, and escape the suspicion which publicity does not fail to
attach to a name. If, on the other hand, no notice was taken of the
communication, the screw received some further turns. A narrative
was drawn up, and printed off, in the form of a newspaper paragraph,
and was transmitted to the parties concerned, with a letter, intimating
that it had been &lsquo;received from a correspondent,&rsquo; and that the
publisher thought fit, prior to publication, to ascertain whether those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>116</span>
whose names were mentioned desired to correct, modify, or cancel
any part of the statement. There is no doubt that very large sums
have been extorted by these scoundrelly means, and a vast amount
of anxiety and misery occasioned.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_62" href="#Footnote_62"><span class="sp">62</span></a> This was &ldquo;the sort of man&rdquo;
that Charles Molloy Westmacott appears to have been; and I learn
on the same authority that by these means he was enabled in one
instance alone to net not much less than a sum of £5,000. &ldquo;Pulls&rdquo;
of this kind enabled this fellow to live at his ease in a suburban
retreat situated somewhere between Barnes and Richmond, which he
fitted up (for he considered himself, as some others of his more
modern class appear to do, a &ldquo;man of letters&rdquo;) with books and
pictures.</p>

<p>In 1825 this man brought out, under his pseudonym of &ldquo;Bernard
<span class="sn">&ldquo;The English Spy.&rdquo;</span>
Blackmantle,&rdquo; a veritable <i>chronique scandaleuse</i> of the time, entitled,
&ldquo;The English Spy,&rdquo; the title page of which describes it as &ldquo;an original
work, characteristic, satirical, and humorous, containing scenes and
sketches in every rank of society; being portraits of the Illustrious
Eminent, Eccentric and Notorious, drawn from the Life by Bernard
Blackmantle.&rdquo; This extraordinary <span class="correction" title="amended from works">work</span> presents us with pictures
of &ldquo;life&rdquo; at Eton, at Oxford, and in fashionable society in London,
Brighton, Cheltenham, Bath, and elsewhere; and the seventy-two
admirable copperplate aqua-tinted etchings, with one exception
(which is by the veteran Rowlandson), are the work of Isaac Robert
Cruikshank. This is a far rarer and more valuable book than the
&ldquo;Life in London.&rdquo; In place of &ldquo;Corinthian&rdquo; hook-nosed Tom,
rosy-cheeked Jerry, and the vulgar <i>gobemouche</i> Logic, we find
figuring amongst the interesting groups, scenes, and characters all
the notabilities of the day: celebrities such as George the Fourth
and his favourite sultana the Marchioness of Conyngham, the
Princess Augusta, Charles Kemble, Matthews, Fawcett, Farren,
Grimaldi, Macready, Young, T. P. Cooke, Elliston, Dowton, Harley,
Munden, Liston, Wallack, Madame Vestris, Townsend (the Bow
Street &ldquo;runner&rdquo;), &ldquo;Pea Green&rdquo; Hayne, Lord William Lennox,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>117</span>
Colonel Berkeley, Hughes Ball, and others. The etchings are singularly
clear and distinct, and the colouring bright and pleasing.
Among the illustrations which specially deserve notice are: <i>The
Oppidans&rsquo; Museum</i>; <i>The Eton Montem</i> (an admirable design); <i>The
First Bow to Alma Mater</i>; <i>College Comforts</i> (a freshman taking
possession of his rooms); <i>Kensington Gardens Sunday Evenings, Singularities
of 1824</i> (woodcut); <i>The Opera Green-room, or Noble Amateurs
viewing Foreign Curiosities</i>; <i>Oxford Transports, or Albanians doing
Penance for Past Offences</i>; <i><span class="correction" title="amended from the">The</span> King at Home, or Mathews at Carlton
House</i>; <i>A Visit to Billingsgate</i>; <i>Characters on the Steyne, Brighton</i>;
<i>The Cogged Dice, Interior of a Modern Hell</i>; <i>City Ball at the
Mansion House</i>; <i>The Wake</i>; <i>The Cyprians&rsquo; Ball at the Argyle
Rooms</i>; <i>The Post Office Bristol, Arrival of the London Mail</i>; <i>The
Fancy Ball at the Upper Rooms, Bath</i>; and <i>Milsom Street and Bond
Street</i>, containing portraits of Bath fashionables.</p>

<p>The so-called <i>Oppidans&rsquo;<a name="FnAnchor_63" href="#Footnote_63"><span class="sp">63</span></a> Museum</i> is composed of the signs stolen
by Eton scapegraces from the local tradesmen; a mock court is in
progress, at which the injured parties attend and either claim or
receive compensation for their stolen property. The tradesmen in
the plate before us look anything but injured persons, and as a
matter of fact the award is sufficiently ample to make amends for
all damage. The two persons officiating as assessors and apportioning
compensation to the various claimants, are Westmacott and
&ldquo;Robert Transit&rdquo; (the artist himself). The illustration is full of
life and character. Among the groups may be noticed a young
fellow holding a bull-terrier suspended by its teeth from a handkerchief;
a bet depends on the dog&rsquo;s patience and strength of jaw, and
an interested companion watches the result, chronometer in hand.
<i>The King at Home</i>, represents a scene which is said to have actually
taken place when Mathews was giving his entertainment at Carlton
House. The performer was imitating Kemble, when the king started
up, and to the surprise of every one, particularly of Mathews, interrupted
the performance by a personal and very clever imitation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>118</span>
the actor, who, by the way, had taught him elocution. This, indeed,
was one of George&rsquo;s strong points, who, if not a good king,
was at least an admirable mimic. Says old Dr. Burney (writing to
his daughter on the 12th of July, 1805), &ldquo;He is a most excellent
mimic of well-known characters; had we been in the dark, any
one would have sworn that Dr. Parr and <i>Kemble</i> were in the
room.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_64" href="#Footnote_64"><span class="sp">64</span></a> In this plate we find likenesses not only of the king
and of Mathews, but also of the Princess Augusta and the too
celebrated Marchioness of Conyngham.</p>

<p>Thomas Rowlandson&rsquo;s single pictorial contribution to the &ldquo;English
Spy,&rdquo; <i>R&mdash;&mdash; A&mdash;&mdash;ys of Genius Reflecting on the True Line of Beauty
at the Life Academy</i>, is described by Mr. Grego under date of 1825.
This is not the only time in which the artist was associated in work
with Rowlandson. There is a rare work (one of an annual series)&mdash;&ldquo;The
Spirit of the Public Journals,&rdquo; for the year 1824, with explanatory
notes by C. M. Westmacott, a collection of whimsical extracts
from the press, which appeared in print in the previous season, which
has illustrations on wood by four distinguished coadjutors: Thomas
Rowlandson, George Cruikshank, Isaac Robert Cruikshank, and
Theodore Lane.</p>

<p>The Foote <i>v.</i> Hayne affair mentioned in our last chapter afforded
<span class="sn">&ldquo;FitzAlleyne of Berkeley.&rdquo;</span>
grist for the kind of mill driven by literary blacklegs of the class of
&ldquo;Bernard Blackmantle.&rdquo; The black-mail system was tried at first,
and when that failed he produced the now rare <i>FitzAlleyne of
Berkeley: a Romance of the Present Times</i>, a pair of libellous volumes,
the <i>dramatis personæ</i> of which comprise the persons whose names
were mentioned in connection with the case. &ldquo;Maria Pous&rdquo; was
of course Maria Foote; Samuel Pous, her father; Lord A&mdash;&mdash;y,
Alvanley; Major H&mdash;&mdash;r, Major George Hanger, afterwards Lord
Coleraine; Optimus, Mr. Tom Best (who shot Lord Camelford in
a duel); the Pea-green Count and FitzAlleyne of Berkeley speak
for themselves; while &ldquo;Mary Carbon&rdquo; is the butcher&rsquo;s daughter
of Gloucester, mother of the Colonel, and afterwards Countess of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>119</span>
Berkeley. Such a character as Molloy, otherwise Westmacott, was
bound to get sometimes into trouble (in these days he would probably
receive his reward for &ldquo;endeavouring to extort money by
threats&rdquo;); and if he did not get exactly what he deserved, he did
get, on the tenth of October, 1830, a tremendous thrashing from
Charles Kemble. References to the memorandum books of this
Ishmaelite of the press, in which he entered (for future use) some
of the scandalous chronicles of his time, and which were offered
for sale at his death in 1868, will be found in Mr. Bates&rsquo;s interesting
book, from which we have already quoted.</p>

<p>Returning to his friend and coadjutor, Robert Cruikshank, the
<span class="sn">&ldquo;Points of Humour.&rdquo;</span>
best of the artist&rsquo;s coloured illustrations to the &ldquo;English Spy&rdquo; are
contained in the first volume; in the second he falls into those
habits of carelessness which, with all his ability and artistic talent,
were a besetting weakness. Robert lacked the genius, the fine
fancy, the careful, delicate handling of George. Up to the publication
of the &ldquo;Life,&rdquo; the brothers as we have seen had worked together
frequently, but after this period they separated. George had
already achieved one of his earliest triumphs in book illustration&mdash;&ldquo;The
Points of Humour,&rdquo; which provoked the universal admiration
of the critics, and proclaimed him one of the most original geniuses
of the time. The &ldquo;Life,&rdquo; however, had made both brothers famous,
and the general public had scarcely yet learnt to distinguish
between the pencils of George and Robert. This confusion was
taken advantage of by unscrupulous publishers (a practice at which
Robert himself seems to have connived) to trade upon the popularity
of the Cruikshank name. We frequently find, for instance, in literary
advertisements of the time, that a forthcoming book is illustrated by
&ldquo;Cruikshank,&rdquo; and the work we have just named is a case in point.
No sooner had the &ldquo;Points of Humour&rdquo; appeared and made their
mark, than they were followed by an announcement by Sherwood,
Jones &amp; Co., of the &ldquo;Points of Misery,&rdquo; the letterpress by Charles
Molloy Westmacott, and the designs by &ldquo;Cruikshank,&rdquo; that is to
say&mdash;Robert. Although this publication is marred by the slovenliness
of execution which characterised the artist in his careless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>120</span>
moods, a few of the designs are excellent, and the tailpieces&mdash;<i>A Six
Inside</i>, at page 36; <i>Cleaned Out</i>, at page 88; and the <i>Pawn Shop</i>, at
page 87&mdash;suffice to show of how much better work Robert Cruikshank
was capable. George, as was usual with him on these occasions,
was horribly annoyed, and loudly and (as it seems to us)
unnecessarily proclaimed to the world that he had no connection
with the work. Probably this manifesto did no good to a book
little calculated either by its literary or pictorial merits to command
success; and as the copy before us remained uncut from the date of
the publication until the present, the inference is that the speculation
of Messrs. Sherwood, Jones &amp; Co., proved scarcely a remunerative
one.</p>

<p>Among the forgotten books of half a century ago, we meet with
one whose title reminds us of the &ldquo;Life in London.&rdquo; It is called,
&ldquo;Doings in London; or, Day and Night Scenes of the Frauds,
Frolics, Manners, and Depravities of the Metropolis.&rdquo; It came out
in threepenny numbers, in 1828, and its professed object (in the
queer language of George Smeeton, its compiler and publisher) was
to &ldquo;show vice and deception in all their real deformity, and not
by painting in glowing colours the fascinating allurements, the mischievous
frolics and vicious habits of the profligate, the heedless,
and the debauchee, tempt youth to commit those irregularities which
often lead to dangerous consequences, not only to themselves but
also to the public.&rdquo; This shot of course was aimed at Pierce
Egan, who, engaged at that time in bringing out the &ldquo;Finish,&rdquo; not
unnaturally considered these &ldquo;Doings&rdquo; an attempt to derive profit
by an indirect infringement of his own title. The title in fact <i>was</i>
a misleading one, and the book a specimen of a class of useless
literature of the time, by which paste-and-scissors information
compiled from books, newspapers, and statistics by some one at
best imperfectly acquainted with his subject, was attempted to be
conveyed by means of questions and answers, supplemented by
dreary and unnecessary remarks of a moralizing tendency. The
persons in whose company Smeeton would send us round, in order
that we may form a just conception of the &ldquo;vice and deception in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>121</span>
all their real deformity,&rdquo; of which he speaks, are a couple of idiots,
one Peregrine Wilson, and an attendant mentor, whom we drop
at the earliest convenient opportunity. Information combined
with morality is all very well. The &ldquo;History of Sandford and
Merton&rdquo; may have been, as Lord Houghton assures us it was, &ldquo;the
delight of the youth of the first generation of the present century.&rdquo;
As one of the youth of the generation referred to, we refuse to
admit it, and we are perfectly certain that the youth of the present
generation would have nothing whatever to do with it. We resign
ourselves preferentially to the guidance of Isaac Robert and George
Cruikshank, sensible that they at least, while conversant with the
scenes they so graphically describe, will not bore us with unnecessary
moral reflections. We prefer, if the truth must be told, to
&ldquo;sport a toe among the Corinthians at Almack&rsquo;s&rdquo; with hooked-nosed
Tom and rosy-cheeked Jerry; to visit with these merry and
by no means strait-laced persons, Mr. O&rsquo;Shaunessy&rsquo;s rooms in
the Haymarket; the back parlour of the respected Thomas Cribb,
ex-champion of England; to take wine with them &ldquo;in the wood&rdquo;
at the London Docks; to enjoy with them, if they will, &ldquo;the
humours of a masquerade supper at the opera house.&rdquo; The
work which Smeeton designed with such indifferent success was
subsequently carried out in a far more efficient manner by Mr.
James Grant, in his &ldquo;Sketches in London,&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_65" href="#Footnote_65"><span class="sp">65</span></a> and at a later date
by Mr. Mayhew, in his well-known &ldquo;London Labour and the
London Poor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Doings in London&rdquo; owe whatever value they possess to
the thirty-nine curious designs on wood of Isaac Robert Cruikshank,
engraved by W. C. Bonner, which, on the whole fair examples of
his workmanship in this style, strongly remind us of the smaller
woodcuts in Hone&rsquo;s &ldquo;Every-Day Book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The best specimens, however, of Robert&rsquo;s designs on wood are
those which will be found in two small volumes, known indifferently
as &ldquo;Facetiæ&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cruikshank&rsquo;s Comic Album,&rdquo; which contain a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>122</span>
series of <i>jeux d&rsquo;esprits</i>, published between the years 1830 and 1832,
and comprising <i>Old Bootey&rsquo;s Ghost</i> and <i>The Man of Intellect</i>, by
W. F. Moncrieff; <i>The High-mettled Racer</i> and <i>Monsieur Nongtongpaw</i>,
by Charles Dibdin; <i>Margate and Brighton</i>; <i>The Devil&rsquo;s
Visit</i>; <i>Steamers and Stages</i>; <i>Monsieur Touson</i>; <i>Monsieur Mallet</i>,
by H. W. Montague; <i>Mathew&rsquo;s Comic Annual</i> (a miserable
<i>mélange</i> by our friend Pierce Egan); the famous <i>Devil&rsquo;s Walk</i>, by
Coleridge and Southey, etc., etc. These little volumes, which are
now rare, contain nearly one hundred excellent examples of Robert
Cruikshank&rsquo;s workmanship, the woodcuts being executed after the
artist&rsquo;s designs by W. C. Bonner and other wood engravers of
eminence. We can stay only to describe one, which illustrates one
of the many experiences of John Bull in his memorable visit to
France. Struck with the appearance of a French lady, &ldquo;young and
gay,&rdquo; the stanza tells us&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;Struck by her charms he ask&rsquo;d her name</p>
  <p class="i2">Of the first man he saw;</p>
<p class="i05">From whom, with shrugs, no answer came</p>
  <p class="i2">But, &lsquo;<i>Je vous n&rsquo;entends pas.</i>&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Three other books (two of them exceedingly rare) must suffice
to complete our survey of Robert&rsquo;s merits as a designer and book
illustrator. These are &ldquo;Colburn&rsquo;s Kalendar of Amusements&rdquo; (1840),
&ldquo;Job Crithannah&rsquo;s Original Fables&rdquo; (1834), and Eugene Sue&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Orphan.&rdquo; There is an Irishman sitting on a barrel in one of the
woodcuts to the &ldquo;Kalendar,&rdquo; who quite equals any of the Hibernians
of George. The eighty-four designs to the &ldquo;Fables&rdquo; are
admirable specimens of the artist&rsquo;s best manner, and George himself
rarely executed better illustrations than those of the <i>Farmer and
the Pointer</i>, at page 110, <i>The Cow and the Farmer</i>, at page 163, and
<i>The Old Woman and her Cat</i>, at page 219. This rare and choice
book abounds with admirable tailpieces; one of which exhibits a
sufferer down in the agonies of gout, the treatment of which subject
may even be compared with the more elaborate and admirable
design by the brother described by Thackeray. Sue&rsquo;s &ldquo;Orphan&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>123</span>
has numerous carefully executed etchings by the artist, after the
style and manner of his brother; in the very signature, &ldquo;Robert
Cruikshank,&rdquo; we trace a distinct copy of George&rsquo;s peculiar trademark
or sign-manual. Mr. Walter Hamilton, in his essay on the
brother, presents us with a dozen copies of Robert&rsquo;s designs, eight
of which, although unacknowledged, are taken from Crithannah&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Fables,&rdquo; and will bear as much comparison with the original and
beautiful woodcuts as the work of a common sign-painter with a
finished painting by Landseer. A detailed but probably imperfect
list of the artist&rsquo;s book work will be found in the <i>appendix</i>.</p>

<p>The name of Robert Cruikshank has slipped out of the place it
once occupied in public estimation; and his good work and his
poor work being equally scarce, his name and his claims to rank
high among the number of English caricaturists and comic artists
have been forgotten even by the survivors of the generation to which
he himself belonged. In bringing to the remembrance of those who
do know, and to the knowledge of those who do not know, some of
the work which entitled him in our judgment to occupy a leading
place amongst the number of those of whom we write, we have
endeavoured to brush away the dust of oblivion which for so many
years has obscured the name and reputation of an artist, who, in
spite of much slovenliness and carelessness of execution, was both
an able caricaturist and a skilful draughtsman. George writes of
his dead brother in terms of affection, and describes him as &ldquo;a
very clever miniature and portrait painter, and also a designer and
etcher;&rdquo; his friend and coadjutor, the late George Daniel, gives him
credit for genius, of which however (in the sense in which we use
and understand the word) he did not possess a particle. He tells
us that &ldquo;he was apt to conceive and prompt to execute; he had a
quick eye and a ready hand; with all his extravagant drollery, his
drawing is anatomically correct; his details are minute, expressive,
and of careful finish, and his colouring is bright and delicate.&rdquo; In
the early part of his career, as we have seen, the two brothers had
been so closely associated in life and in art, that the history of
Robert is, to some extent, the history of George; but when they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>124</span>
separated, when each was left to his own individual resources,
George then struck into a path which neither Robert nor any of his
contemporaries might hope to follow. By the time Robert had
realized this fact, <span class="cn">HB</span> had appeared, and the art of caricaturing, as
theretofore practised, received a blow from which it will never rally.
Besides being an able water colour artist, he had at one time
achieved some reputation as a portrait painter; but the latter
pursuit he had long practically abandoned, while success in the
former required a closer application and the exercise of a greater
amount of patience than a man of his age and temperament could
afford to bestow. He was, in fact, too old to commence life afresh;
and so it came inevitably to pass that, as his brother did in after life
(but from causes, as we shall see, widely different), Robert gradually
dropped behind and was forgotten. He had not the genius or pride
in his art of his brother, and looked rather to that art as a means of
present livelihood than of acquiring a permanent and enduring
reputation. If George&mdash;with all his pride in his art, with all his
genius, with all his rare gifts of imagination and fancy&mdash;was
destined to be left behind in the race of life, what could poor
Robert hope for? It is sad to think that in later life, poor easy-going,
thriftless, careless, Bohemian Robert sank into neglect and
consequent poverty. He died (of bronchitis) on the 13th of March,
1856, in his sixty-sixth year.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<h5><i>THE CARICATURES OF GEORGE CRUIKSHANK.</i></h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Just</span> sixty years ago, a writer in <i>Blackwood</i> spoke of the subject of
<span class="sn">Sixty Years ago.</span>
the present chapter (then a young man who had already acquired
an artistic reputation) in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is high time that the public should think more than they have
hitherto done of George Cruikshank; and it is also high time that
George Cruikshank should begin to think more than he seems
to have done hitherto of himself. Generally speaking, people
consider him as a clever, sharp <i>caricaturist</i>, and nothing more; a
free-handed, comical young fellow, who will do anything he is paid
for, and who is quite contented to dine off the proceeds of a
&rsquo;George IV.&rsquo; to-day, and those of a &lsquo;Hone,&rsquo; or a &lsquo;Cobbett&rsquo;
to-morrow. He himself, indeed, appears to be the most careless
creature alive, as touching his reputation. He seems to have no
plan&mdash;almost no ambition&mdash;and, I apprehend, not much industry.
He does just what is suggested or thrown in his way, pockets the
cash, orders his beef-steak and bowl, and chaunts, like one of his
own heroes,&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&rsquo;Life is all a variorium,</p>
<p class="i05">We regard not how it goes.&rsquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">Now, for a year or two to begin with, this is just what it should be.
Cruikshank was resolved to see <i>Life</i>,<a name="FnAnchor_66" href="#Footnote_66"><span class="sp">66</span></a> and his sketches show that he
has seen it, in some of its walks, to purpose. But life is short, and
art is long; and our gay friend must pull up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he is not aware of the fact himself&mdash;but a fact it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>126</span>
undoubtedly is&mdash;that he possesses genius&mdash;genius in its truest sense&mdash;strong,
original, English genius. Look round the world of art,
and ask, How many are there of whom anything like this can be
said? Why, there are not half a dozen names that could bear being
mentioned at all; and certainly there is not one, the pretensions of
which will endure sifting, more securely and more triumphantly than
that of George Cruikshank. In the first place, he is&mdash;what no living
<i>caricaturist</i> but himself has the least pretensions to be, and what,
indeed, scarcely one of their predecessors was&mdash;he is a thoroughbred
<i>artist</i>.<a name="FnAnchor_67" href="#Footnote_67"><span class="sp">67</span></a> He draws with the ease and freedom and fearlessness of a
master; he understands the figure completely; and appears, so far
as one can guess from the trifling sort of things he has done, to have
a capital notion of the principles of grouping. Now these things are
valuable in themselves, but they are doubly, trebly valuable as
possessed by a person of real comic humour; and a total despiser
of that Venerable Humbug which almost all the artists of our day
seem, in one shape or other, to revere as the prime god of their
idolatry. Nobody, that has the least of an eye for art, can doubt
that Cruikshank, if he chose, might design as many annunciations,
beatifications, apotheoses, metamorphoses, and so forth, as would
cover York cathedral from end to end. It is still more impossible
to doubt that he might be a famous portrait painter. Now, these
are fine lines both of them, and yet it is precisely the chief merit of
Cruikshank that he cuts them both; that he will have nothing to do
with them; that he has chosen a walk of his own, and that he
has made his own walk popular. Here lies genius; but let him
do himself justice; let him persevere and <i>rise</i> in his own path, and
then, ladies and gentlemen, <i>then</i> the day will come when his name
will be a name indeed, not a name puffed and paraded in the
newspapers, but a living, a substantial, perhaps even an illustrious,
English name. Let him, in one word, proceed, and, as he proceeds,
let him think of Hogarth.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_68" href="#Footnote_68"><span class="sp">68</span></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>127</span></p>

<p>Now, although amused (and surely he cannot fail to be amused)
at the curious incapacity of an art critic so strangely ignorant of
his subject as to conceive <i>George Cruikshank</i> an artist capable
of designing <i>annunciations</i>, <i>beatifications</i>, <i>apotheoses</i>, and subjects so
completely out of the range of his sympathies and abilities, the
reader will, at the same time, be struck with the prescience of the
intelligent writer who discerned in him the possession of true genius,
and predicted for him, even at this early period of his career, the
reputation&mdash;&ldquo;living, substantial,&rdquo; and &ldquo;illustrious&rdquo;&mdash;which he afterwards
so justly achieved for himself.</p>

<p>In everything save the power to realize an annunciation, a
beatification, or an apotheosis, George Cruikshank was, at the
time this article was penned, exactly what Mr. Lockhart describes
him. The most able and accomplished of the caricaturists of his
time, he was nevertheless willing to etch the works of an amateur
or of an artist inferior to himself, to whose work he has frequently
imparted a vitality of which it would have been destitute but for the
interposition of his hand. He was ready, moreover, to execute
woodcuts for a song-book or the political skits of any scribbler of his
time, whether on the ministerial or the popular side mattered little
to him. It was therefore not unnatural that doing &ldquo;just what was
suggested or thrown in his way,&rdquo; Lockhart should come to the
erroneous conclusion that the artist had &ldquo;no plan,&rdquo; &ldquo;no ambition,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;not much industry.&rdquo; The assertion that he had &ldquo;no ambition&rdquo;
has been amply disproved by his subsequent life, whilst so
far from having &ldquo;no plan,&rdquo; the sequel shows that all this time,
unsuspected by the critic, he had been gradually developing the
style of illustration by which he made his mark and reputation,&mdash;a
style first displayed in the celebrated &ldquo;Points of Humour,&rdquo; the
publication of which served as the occasion for Lockhart&rsquo;s criticism.</p>

<p>On this account, if for no other reason, the caricatures of George
Cruikshank possess so remarkable an interest, that it is singular
that this field of artistic labour has been left almost unexplored
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>128</span>
by the essayists, many of whom, with a somewhat imperfect knowledge
of their subject, have essayed to give us information on the
subject of this artist and his works. It is just this early period
of his life, in which he first followed and then gradually emancipated
himself from the artistic control and influence of Gillray,
which seems to us to afford the most interesting study of the
man&rsquo;s career. Nevertheless, nearly all the articles we have read
on George Cruikshank would give us the idea that, with the
exception of certain designs for woodcuts for Hone&mdash;such as the
celebrated <i>Non Mi Ricordo</i> and others&mdash;certain rough coloured
engravings for &ldquo;The Meteor,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Scourge,&rdquo; and other periodicals
of a kindred stamp, the artist executed but few caricatures properly
so called. This at least is the impression which these articles
have left on our own minds; and we can only account for the
little notice taken of him as a caricaturist by the fact that, unlike
the etchings which he produced when in the prime of his career,
his caricatures are not only exceedingly scarce, but being in many
cases unsigned, are capable only of being recognised by those
intimately acquainted with his early handiwork.</p>

<p>The caricatures of George Cruikshank may be divided into
three classes: first, those which are wholly designed and etched
by himself; secondly, those which he designed after the sketches
or suggestions of his friends; and thirdly, those merely etched
from the designs of other artists. We find the first, although
frequently unsigned, more usually signed (on the left hand), &ldquo;Geo.
Cruik<span class="sp">k</span>. fect.&rdquo; or &ldquo;invt. &amp; fect.&rdquo;; the second&mdash;&ldquo;invt. G. Cruik<span class="sp">k</span>.
fect.;&rdquo; while the third are indicated as merely <i>etched</i> by him.
Of the second class it may be remarked that with the exception
of the mere sketch or suggestion, the drawing and the workmanship
are oftentimes unmistakably George&rsquo;s own. In the description
of his caricatures which follow, we shall indicate the designs
which belong to <i>this</i> class with an asterisk.</p>

<p>Publications such as &ldquo;The Scourge,&rdquo; although containing many
caricature designs by George Cruikshank, are scarcely among
those to which the present chapter was intended to be devoted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>129</span>
There are, however, two satirical compositions of his in this scurrilous
publication,<a name="FnAnchor_69" href="#Footnote_69"><span class="sp">69</span></a> which appear to us so exceptionally good, that
we feel justified in drawing special attention to them. As the
publication itself affords little or no clue to the subject of the
illustrations, it seems necessary in order that the first may be
understood, to explain the circumstances which appear to us to
have led up to it.</p>

<p>For several years prior to 1811, the established clergy had
<span class="sn">1811.</span>
manifested considerable uneasiness on account of the rapid spread
of Methodism. The readiness with which licenses for preaching
could be obtained according to the usual interpretation of the
Toleration Act, had tended to the multiplication of a class of
preachers whose manners and language peculiarly fitted them for
acquiring influence over the inferior ranks of the people; and by
this means a great diminution had taken place in the congregations
of parish churches. It is affirmed&mdash;with what truth we know not&mdash;that
Lord Sidmouth in the measure (presently to be noticed)
was encouraged to proceed in his design by letters from persons
of high position in the Church.</p>

<p>On the 9th of May, 1811, Lord Sidmouth moved in the House
<span class="sn">Lord Sidmouth&rsquo;s Motion.</span>
of Lords for leave to bring in a bill for amending and explaining
the Acts of William and Mary and 17th George III., so far as
applied to dissenting ministers. According to the statement of
his lordship, at most of the quarter sessions, when the oaths were
taken and the declarations made requisite for enabling a person
to officiate in a chapel or meeting-house, any person, however
ignorant or profligate, was able to obtain a certificate which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>130</span>
authorized him to preach. His lordship proposed that, in order
to entitle any person to a qualification as a preacher, he should
have the recommendation of at least six respectable householders
of the congregation to which he belonged. Lord Holland, in
opposing the bill, observed that he held it to be the inalienable
right of every man who thought himself able to instruct others to
do so, provided his doctrines were not incompatible with the peace
of society.</p>

<p>When the nature and provisions of the proposed measure were
made known to the public, an alarm was excited among all those
whom it was likely to affect. The Nonconformists generally regarded
it as intended, not so much to add to the respectability
of the dissenting ministers, as to contract the limits of toleration,
and subject the licensing of preachers to the control of the
magistracy. When therefore, on the 21st of May, the bill was to
be read a second time, such a deluge of petitions was poured in
against it, that the mover was left totally unsupported. The
Archbishop of Canterbury said with truth, that the Dissenters
were the best judges of their own concerns; and as it appeared
from the great number of petitions against it, that they were hostile
to the bill, he thought it unwise to press the measure against their
manifest wishes. Under these circumstances the bill was, we need
not say, thrown out.</p>

<p>This would appear to be the subject which produced George
Cruikshank&rsquo;s graphic satire of the <i>Interior View of the House of God</i>,
in the first volume of &ldquo;The Scourge.&rdquo; The pulpit is occupied
by two fanatics, one of whom rants, while the other snuffs the
candles; the devil, in the gallery above, ridicules the proceedings
by rasping, <i>à la</i> fiddle, the bars of a gridiron with a poker; among
the numerous congregation present we notice some attentive and
interested listeners, whilst others evidently attend from mere
motives of curiosity. Above the composition appears the quotation,
&ldquo;Believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they
are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the
world.&rdquo; The satire, <i>The Examination of a Young Surgeon</i>, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>131</span>
appears in the same volume, is aimed at the medical profession.
One of the examiners is deaf, another has the gout, a third is
asleep, while two others (unmistakable Scotchmen) discuss the
merits of their respective snuff-mulls. The deaf man calls upon
the frightened candidate to &ldquo;describe the organs of hearing.&rdquo; The
table is garnished with &ldquo;The Cow Pox Chronicle,&rdquo; and a skull
and bones, while the walls are decorated with pictures depicting
a fight between death and a pugilist, the Hottentot Venus, a
group of various nations worshipping the golden calf, and the
lady without arms or legs. The hand of the clock points to the
hour of eleven. Judging by the pile of money-bags lying at the
foot of the president&rsquo;s chair, and the two members of the court
who are busily engaged in counting coin, George would seem to
insinuate that the fellows of the college of his time were a
decidedly mercenary set.</p>

<p>Of character akin to &ldquo;The Scourge&rdquo; (the ten volumes of which
<span class="sn">&ldquo;The Satirist.&rdquo;</span>
were published between 1811 and 1815 inclusive); is &ldquo;The Satirist,
or Monthly Meteor,&rdquo; the thirteen volumes of which made their
appearance between the years 1808 and 1813. Both publications,
which now command prices very far beyond what they are intrinsically
worth, contain a number of satires, of more or less merit (generally
<i>less</i>), by various satirists, including George Cruikshank; so far as
&ldquo;The Satirist&rdquo; is concerned, the designs of the latter are confined to
the thirteenth and last volume, and his caricature contributions are
of a vastly superior order of merit to any of those by which they
are preceded. Besides those in &ldquo;The Scourge&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Satirist,&rdquo;
may be mentioned George Cruikshank&rsquo;s comic designs in &ldquo;Fashion,&rdquo;
printed for J. J. Stockdale, of Pall Mall, in 1818; and his very
admirable series of untinted etchings in &ldquo;The Loyalist Magazine;
or, Anti-Radical,&rdquo; a publication exclusively devoted to the ministerial
side of the Carolinian scandal, and published by James Wright, of
Fleet Street, in 1820.</p>

<p>One of the earliest caricatures I have met with by George
is entitled, <i>Apollyon</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, Napoleon]<i>, the Devil&rsquo;s Generalissimo,
Addressing his Legions</i>; it is signed (contrary to his usual custom),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>132</span>
&ldquo;Cruikshank del.,&rdquo; and was executed (if I am right in assigning it
to him) when he was sixteen years of age.</p>

<p>The attention of the public in 1813 was, as we have seen,
<span class="sn">1813.<br />Discovery of the remains of Charles I.</span>
attracted by the Regent&rsquo;s treatment of his miserable wife; and in
April the sympathy of the Livery and Corporation of London, and
other public bodies, found expression in an address which was
presented to Her Royal Highness. On the 28th of March of that
year, the remains of Charles the First had been discovered in the
vault of Henry the Eighth, at Windsor, a circumstance which
suggested to George Cruikshank his admirable satire entitled, <i>Meditations
amongst the Tombs</i>. It shows us His Royal Highness gazing at
the recovered bodies, and regretting that while Henry had managed
to dispose of many wives, <i>he</i> found it impossible to get rid of one.
A figure behind him points to the headless corpse, and significantly
remarks, &ldquo;How rum King Charley looks without his head!&rdquo; The
Battle of Vitoria (fought this year) forms the subject of a pair of
roughly executed caricatures, entitled respectively, <i>The Battle of
Vitoria</i>, and <i>A Scene after the Battle, or More Trophies for Whitehall</i>.
Other satires of the year, are <i>Double Bass</i>, and <i>A Venomous Viper
Poisoning the R&mdash;l Mind</i>, the latter as coarsely and indelicately
handled a subject as any caricaturist of the old school might possibly
desire.</p>

<p><i>Little Boney gone to Pot</i> (Thomas Tegg, May 12th, 1814), is one of
<span class="sn">1814.</span>
the artist&rsquo;s contributions to the series of caricatures which followed
the fall of Napoleon Bonaparte. Here the satirist has seated the
emperor (a lean, ragged, forlorn, miserable, diseased object) on a
huge article of bedroom furniture, labelled, &ldquo;Imperial Throne.&rdquo;
He is in a forlorn condition, suffering from itch, with large excrescences
growing on his toes. He is all alone in his island prison
(Elba), and tempted by a fiend, who tenders him a pistol&mdash;&ldquo;If you
have one spark of courage left,&rdquo; it says, &ldquo;take this.&rdquo; &ldquo;Perhaps I
may,&rdquo; replies Napoleon, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;ll take the flint out.&rdquo; By his side
we find a pot of brimstone, numerous medicine bottles, and &ldquo;a
treatise on the itch, by Dr. Scratch.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_70" href="#Footnote_70"><span class="sp">70</span></a> One of the imperial boots,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>133</span>
mounted on a tiny carriage, forms a dummy cannon. His back
leans against a tree, to which is nailed the &ldquo;Imperial Crow,&rdquo; while
from the branches depends a ragged pair of breeches and stockings.
It was a sorry libel on the unfortunate emperor, whose courage was
undoubted, and who, at this time, instead of being the scarecrow the
artist has represented him, had grown extremely corpulent. <i>Snuffing
out Boney</i> follows up the same subject, and represents a cossack
snuffing out Napoleon, who figures as a candle; another caricature
on the great subject of the year bears the title of <i>Broken Gingerbread</i>
(Napoleon selling images).</p>

<p>RUSSIAN CONDESCENSION, OR THE BLESSINGS OF UNIVERSAL PEACE.</p>

<p class="ar">[<i>Face page 133.</i></p></td></tr></table></div>

<p>On the 8th of June, 1814, the Emperor of Russia, with his sister
<span class="sn">Visit of the Allied Sovereigns.</span>
the Duchess Oldenburg, the King of Prussia, and his two sons,
with Prince Metternich, Marshal Blucher, General Barclay de Tolly,
the Hetman Platoff, and other persons of distinction, arrived in
London. The strangers were splendidly entertained by the merchants
and bankers of London at Merchant Taylors&rsquo; Hall, and by
the Corporation of London at Guildhall. On the 20th there was a
grand review of regulars and metropolitan volunteers in Hyde Park;
the ceremony of announcing to the inhabitants of the metropolis
the conclusion of the definitive treaty of peace with France took
place with all its ancient and accustomed solemnities. On the 25th
of July a grand naval review was held at Portsmouth, and on the
27th the illustrious visitors embarked at Dover for the Continent.
The handsome Russian emperor and his handsome sister acquired
great popularity by the condescension and affability they displayed
during their short visit. This is commemorated by George Cruikshank
in a satire published by Fores on the 11th of July, entitled,
<i>Russian Condescension, or the Blessings of Peace</i>, in which a coarse
woman is represented as kissing the emperor, who is habited in
English military uniform. &ldquo;There, Sal,&rdquo; says she to her companion,
&ldquo;I can boast of what none of the &mdash;&mdash;s at Billingsgate can, having
kissed the king&rsquo;s emperor of all the Russian bears, and he is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>134</span>
sweetest, modestest, mildest gentleman I ever kissed in all my life.&rdquo;
On the other side a huge country gawky shakes hands with the
duchess, whose vast bonnet is a study. &ldquo;Dang it,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;when
I goes back and tells the folks in our village of this, law! how they
will envy I!&rdquo; In the distance we see another female in pursuit of
the frightened Hetman Platoff.</p>

<p>The reader will remember, that from the state ceremonies and festivities
which took place on this memorable occasion the miserable
Caroline had been excluded, nor did she of course receive recognition
or visits from any of her husband&rsquo;s illustrious visitors. The
state of social isolation to which she was thus consigned is referred
to by George Cruikshank in a very roughly executed caricature
entitled, <i>The British Spread Eagle</i>, &ldquo;Presented to the northern
monarchs as a model for their national banner in consequence of
the general peace.&rdquo; The Regent, holding in his hand a bottle of
port wine, turns away from his neglected wife: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;to my bottle, my marchioness [of Conyngham], my countess&rdquo; [of
Jersey], who may be seen close at hand in an adjoining thicket;
&ldquo;and I,&rdquo; answers Caroline, &ldquo;to my child, my only comfort.&rdquo; The
&ldquo;only comfort&rdquo; is seen coming to her mother&rsquo;s assistance in the distance,
uttering the trite quotation, &ldquo;The child that feels not for a
mother&rsquo;s woes, can ne&rsquo;er be called a Briton.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>The Impostor, or Obstetric Dispute</i>, a still more roughly executed
satire (published by Tegg in September, 1814), refers to the
wretched impostor Southcott. Doctors called in to report on her
condition &ldquo;differed&rdquo; according to their proverbial custom. Three of
these learned pundits may be seen in consultation in the right-hand
corner. A blatant and irascible cobbler, standing on a stool, loudly
proclaims the woman to be &ldquo;a cheat!&rdquo; &ldquo;a faggot!&rdquo; &ldquo;a bag of
deceit!&rdquo; &ldquo;a blasphemous old hag!&rdquo; The indignant Joanna, far
advanced in her dropsical condition, rushes at him, brandishing a
broom in one hand and her book of prophecies in the other, to the
delight of certain members of the &ldquo;great unwashed.&rdquo; The buildings
at the back appropriately include &ldquo;New Bethlehem,&rdquo; and the
house which the reader may remember was engaged for the purposes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>135</span>
of her miraculous <i>accouchement</i>. A rougher and coarser piece of
workmanship, if possible, will be found in <i>Gambols on the River
Thames, February, 1814</i> (published also by Tegg), which commemorates
the memorable frost of that year.</p>

<p>On the 17th of February, 1815, Mr. Frederick Robinson, vice-president
<span class="sn">1815.<br />The Corn Laws.</span>
of the board of trade, moved for the House of Commons to
resolve itself into a committee of the whole house, for the purpose
of considering the state of the corn laws. This having been done, he
proceeded to lay before the House certain resolutions, three of
which related to the free importation of grain to be warehoused and
afterwards exported, or to be taken for home consumption when
importation for that purpose was allowable. The fourth and most
important stated the average price of British corn at which free
importation was to be allowed, and <i>below which it was to be prohibited</i>,
and this for wheat was fixed at eighty shillings per quarter.
An exception was made in favour of grain produced in the British
colonies, which might be imported when British grown wheat was at
sixty-seven shillings. All the resolutions were read and agreed to,
with the exception of the fourth, and this in the end also passed in
the face of every amendment.</p>

<p>On the 1st of March, Mr. Robinson brought in his bill &ldquo;to
amend the laws now in force for regulating the importation of
corn.&rdquo; By this time very numerous petitions against the bill were
coming in from the commercial and manufacturing districts; riotous
proceedings also took place on the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th of March,
in the course of which the mob cut to pieces many valuable pictures
belonging to Mr. Robinson, destroyed and pitched his furniture into
the street, and did a variety of mischief to the property of other
well-known supporters of the measure. The riots (which were of a
most formidable character) were only quelled by the number and
determined attitude of the military and constables. In spite, however,
of the unmistakable unpopularity of the measure, and of the
strenuous opposition to it both in and out of Parliament, the bill
passed the House on the 10th of March, and the Upper House
on the 20th.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>136</span></p>

<p>The consequences of this measure were not such as were expected
either by its promoters or opposers. Former importations, or more
probably the effect of two abundant harvests, combined with the
greatly extended cultivation of grain, produced a gradual and steady
reduction in prices; so that instead of approaching the limits at
which alone importation was allowable by the Act, it sunk to a level
below that of several years past. The farmers, who were labouring
under exorbitant rents in addition to other increased expenses, were
general sufferers, and the landlords found it necessary in many
instances to make great abatements in their dues. In the result
many leases were voided and farms left without tenants.</p>

<p>To this most unpopular measure a satire, published by Fores on
the 3rd of March, 1815, has reference. It is entitled, <i>The Blessings
of Peace, or the Curse of the Corn Bill</i>, a very rough affair, etched
by George (as it appears to me) from the design of an amateur
whose hand may be recognised in more than one of his caricatures.
A foreign vessel is approaching our shores laden with best wheat
at 50<i>s.</i> a quarter. A figure with a star on his breast, emblematical
of course of the aristocratic influence which was supposed to have
dictated the unpopular corn law, forbids the sailors to land it: &ldquo;We
won&rsquo;t have it,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;<i>at any price</i>. We are determined to keep up
our own to 80<i>s.</i>, and if the poor can&rsquo;t buy at that price, why, they
must starve. We love money too well to lower our rents again,
tho&rsquo; the income tax <i>is</i> taken off.&rdquo; His sentiments are re-echoed by
companions belonging to the same class as himself. A farmer and
his starving family, however, come forward. &ldquo;No, no, masters,&rdquo; he
remonstrates; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not starve, but quit my native country, where
the poor are crushed by those they labour to support, and retire to
one more hospitable, and where threats of the rich do not interpose
to defeat the providence of God!&rdquo; Behind the starving family is
a warehouse absolutely bursting with sacks of grain at 80<i>s.</i> &ldquo;By
gar!&rdquo; says the foreign captain, &ldquo;if they won&rsquo;t have [the wheat] at all,
we must throw it overboard,&rdquo; which they accordingly are depicted as
doing. The subject is followed up by a still more slovenly affair
by the artist himself, bearing the title of <i>The Scale of Justice Reversed</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>137</span>
published by Fores on the 29th of March. An eighteenpenny loaf
in one scale is overmatched by the accumulated weight of taxes in
the other. The overbalanced scale in its descent knocks down and
crushes John Bull under its weight. &ldquo;The bread,&rdquo; he cries, &ldquo;is out
of my reach, and those cursed taxes will break my back. That
large one [&rsquo;duty on manufactories,&rsquo; which the chancellor is just
putting into the scale] will do for me.&rdquo; Beyond, a usurer and four
large landowners are seen rejoicing at the flight of the &ldquo;Property
Tax,&rdquo; an alleviation which is calculated to do no good to any one
but themselves.</p>

<p>John Bull&rsquo;s trials, however, were in reality just commencing.
<span class="sn">Napoleon returns from Elba.</span>
Only seven months before he had held a grand &ldquo;jubilee&rdquo; in the
parks, to celebrate the return of peace, treating his little difficulty
with the Americans as a <i>bagatelle</i> not worth serious consideration.
Four months before that celebration, &ldquo;his majesty the Emperor
Napoleon&rdquo; had formally &ldquo;renounced for himself, his successors, etc.,
all right of sovereignty and dominion, as well to the French empire
and the kingdom of Italy, as over every other country.&rdquo; In return
for this concession, as if in absolute mockery, &ldquo;the isle of Elba,
adopted by his majesty the Emperor ... as the place of his
residence,&rdquo; was formed during his life into a separate principality, to
&ldquo;be possessed by him in full <i>sovereignty and property</i>,&rdquo; besides a
certain annual revenue mentioned in the articles of treaty of the
18th of April, 1814. Here the Regent and his very good friends
the allied sovereigns had been content to leave him, dreaming
apparently, that the man whose military genius had held Europe at
defiance, was disposed of &ldquo;for ever and a day;&rdquo; disregarding the
feeble capacity of the Bourbon who succeeded him; the magic influence
wielded by the man who thought the world too small for
his ambition over a soldiery he had created and trained into perfection,
and who regarded him in the light of a demi-god.</p>

<p>On the 26th of February, 1815, Bonaparte embarked at Porto
Ferrago on board a brig, followed by four small vessels conveying
about 1,000 men&mdash;French, Poles, Corsicans, Neapolitans, and natives
of Elba. On the 1st of March the expedition anchored off the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>138</span>
town of Cannes, in Provence, where these heterogeneous forces were
landed. The small and motley force of filibusters was forthwith
marched on Grenoble, which was reached on the 8th. The seventh
regiment of the line, under Colonel Labedoyère, had meanwhile
joined the adventurer; the rest of the garrison opened their gates,
delivered their arsenal and magazine, and thus placed him at the
head of a body of regular troops with a train of artillery. Only five
short months afterwards, while the unfortunate emperor was on his
way to St. Helena, poor Labedoyère was shot on the plain of
Grenelle, for the &ldquo;treason&rdquo; of re-swearing fealty to the original
master he had loved so well.</p>

<p>On the 9th of March, Bonaparte appeared before Lyons, which
he entered without resistance. Once in possession of this important
city, and hailed Emperor by his beloved soldiery, Bonaparte assumed
the &ldquo;sovereignty and dominion&rdquo; which he had &ldquo;renounced&rdquo; for
ever. &ldquo;Frenchmen!&rdquo; he said, after his sententious but stirring
manner, &ldquo;there is no nation, however small it may be, which has
not had the right, and which may not withdraw itself from the disgrace
of obeying a prince imposed on it by an enemy momentarily
victorious. When Charles VII. re-entered Paris, and overthrew the
ephemeral throne of Henry V., he acknowledged that he held his
throne from the valour of his heroes, and <i>not from a Prince Regent
of England</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although the troops assembled around him were comparatively
a handful, Bonaparte had unquestionably obtained sufficient assurance
of the general disposition of the army in his favour. Preparations
indeed had been made for collecting a large body of troops
at Melun for the immediate protection of Paris, while another was
posted at Fontainebleau, so as to place the adventurer as it were
between two fires. The greatest hopes were derived from the
professed loyalty to the Bourbon cause of Marshal Ney, who had
spontaneously presented himself at the Tuileries and proffered his
services to the king. With the marshal, 12,000 or 15,000 men
were posted at Lons-le-Saulnier, whence it was understood that he
would fall on the rear of Bonaparte. Instead of doing so, he joined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>139</span>
him at Auxerre with his whole division, which had already hoisted
(under his orders) the tri-coloured flag. This defection practically
decided the contest; and Bonaparte entered Paris on the evening
of the 20th as a conqueror, received everywhere by the military
in triumph.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on the 13th of March, the powers who had signed the
Treaty of Paris assembled in congress at Vienna, &ldquo;being informed of
the escape of Napoleon Bonaparte, and of his entrance into France
with an armed force,&rdquo; issued a formal declaration, in which they
stated that, &ldquo;by thus breaking the convention which established him
on the island of Elba, Bonaparte had destroyed the only legal title
on which his existence depended; ... deprived himself of the
protection of the law; and manifested to the universe that there
could be neither peace nor truce with him. The powers consequently
declared that he had placed himself without the pale of
civil and social relations, and as an enemy and disturber of the tranquility
of the world, rendered himself liable to public vengeance;&rdquo;
and, by a treaty concluded at Vienna on the 25th of March, Great
Britain, Austria, Russia, and Prussia bound themselves to maintain
the Treaty of Paris of 30th May, 1814, and for that purpose each
was to keep constantly in the field a force of 150,000 men, and not
lay down their arms until Bonaparte should have been rendered
absolutely unable to create disturbance, and &ldquo;renew his attempts for
possessing himself of the supreme power in France.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The excitement which this portentous event occasioned amongst
<span class="sn">Reappearance of Bonaparte.</span>
the nations of Europe is admirably realized by a caricature of George
Cruikshank&rsquo;s, published by Fores on the 6th of April, and entitled,
<i>The Congress Dissolved before the Cake was Cut up</i>. Alexander,
engaged in cutting up the cake (<i>i.e.</i> Europe), and apportioning to each
nationality a share of the whole, drops the knife as Napoleon rushes
in among them, with the tremendous cocked hat, huge sword, and
boots assigned to him on the authority of James Gillray. Crushing
under his feet the &ldquo;Decrees of the Congress,&rdquo; &ldquo;An Account of the
Deliverance of Europe,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Plan for the Security of Europe,&rdquo; and
other documents of a similar character, he shouts to the affrighted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>140</span>
company, &ldquo;Avast! ye bunglers; the cake you have been these six
months disputing about the cutting up, I will do in as many hours.&rdquo;
Holland in his fright has dropped off his stool to the ground. &ldquo;O
Donner and Blixen!&rdquo; he exclaims, &ldquo;<i>my</i> Hollands is all gone!&rdquo; &ldquo;I
thought England had promised to guard him,&rdquo; says Saxony, alluding
to the kind of naval supervision of Elba by English armed cruisers,
which appears to have been exercised, so far as we can see, without
any <i>direct</i> claim on our part to control the movements of Bonaparte.
&ldquo;Hold him! seize him!&rdquo; cries Austria. &ldquo;Seize him! kill him!&rdquo;
re-echoes Prussia.<a name="FnAnchor_71" href="#Footnote_71"><span class="sp">71</span></a> &ldquo;Who&rsquo;ll begin?&mdash;There&rsquo;s the rub!&rdquo; is the
sensible observation of Sweden. &ldquo;Oh dear! oh dear!&rdquo; groans his
holiness the Pope, crowned with a composite hat, the crown of which
is composed of his mitre; &ldquo;what will become of me?&rdquo; The only
one who says nothing, but seems prepared to act with determination
and promptitude, is the representative of England, who is shown in
the act of drawing his sword.</p>

<p>Napoleon (we need not say) did not exactly act as the caricaturist
describes: he endeavoured to re-establish relations with the foreign
powers. On the 14th of April, however, Coulaincourt, the minister
of foreign affairs, published his report to the emperor, giving an
account of the result of the applications which had been made to
foreign courts. From this it appeared that while no communication
was permitted with the actual government of France, all the allied
powers were diligently making preparation for war. &ldquo;In all parts of
Europe at once,&rdquo; said the minister, &ldquo;they are arming, or marching,
or ready to march.&rdquo; The powers, of course, were acting strictly
within the terms of their expressed declaration to make &ldquo;neither
peace nor truce with Bonaparte.&rdquo; The emperor&rsquo;s practical reply to
this declaration was made in the Champ de Mars on the 1st of June.
Descending from his throne, he distributed the imperial eagles to the
troops of the line and the national guards as they marched past, and
swore to defend them at the hazard of their lives, and to suffer no
foreigners to dictate laws to their country. All this time reinforcements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>141</span>
were being despatched from England without intermission,
and the Duke of Wellington had arrived to take command of the
troops, native and foreign, in Belgium. There was nothing left for
Napoleon except to fight. In the latter end of May, the headquarters
of the French army of the north was established at Avesnes,
in French Flanders; while, in the apprehension of an invasion by
the allied armies on that part, Laon and the Castle of Guise were
put in a defensive condition. On the 12th of June Bonaparte left
Paris, accompanied by Marshal Bertrand and General Drouet, and
proceeded to Laon.</p>

<p>At this point we meet with a piece of George Cruikshank&rsquo;s handiwork
which is curious as indicative of the spirit which pervaded
England at this momentous period. I am not at present in a
position to refer to a newspaper of the period; but it would appear
from the sketch referred to that, on or about the very day that
Napoleon left Paris to join the splendid army which six days afterwards
was so disastrously routed at Waterloo, a city fête was held at
the Mansion House, at which that eccentric and sturdy nationalist,
Sir William Curtis, whose face and figure were a fortune to the
caricaturists of the period, covered the floor of the Mansion House
<span class="sn">Tri-coloured &ldquo;Eagles.&rdquo;</span>
with the tri-coloured eagles captured from the French in Peninsular
battle-fields, while the banners of England domineered from the walls
above. The exceedingly rare sketch which illustrates this incident
is labelled appropriately by the artist, <i>Opening of Sir William
Curtis&rsquo;s Campaign against the French Colours</i>.</p>

<p>Six days afterwards, the star of Napoleon Bonaparte had set for
ever in the lurid and ensanguined battle clouds of Waterloo.
Scarcely one month later on&mdash;that is to say, on the 15th of July,
1815&mdash;he had surrendered to Captain Maitland, of his majesty&rsquo;s ship
<i>Bellerophon</i>, under circumstances which, while they reflect no discredit
on the honour of that gallant officer, seem to us, so far as
England was herself concerned, scarcely to have justified her subsequent
treatment of the great but unfortunate emperor. With this,
however, we have nothing to do. The <i>Bellerophon</i> on the evening of
the 23rd, brought the distinguished exile within sight of the coast of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>142</span>
England, a circumstance to which a subsequent caricature (<i>etched</i> by
the artist) has reference. On the 6th of September was published
by Fores, <i>Boney&rsquo;s Threatened Invasion brought to bear, or Taking a
View of the English Coast from ye Poop of the Bellerophon</i>. The
little emperor, confined to the mast by a chain fastened to his leg,
leaps on the breech of one of the <i>Bellerophon&rsquo;s</i> guns, spy-glass in
hand. &ldquo;By gar, mon Empereur,&rdquo; says Count Bertrand, &ldquo;dey have
erect von prospect for you.&rdquo; The &ldquo;prospect&rdquo; is far from encouraging&mdash;a
fort with the English flag flying from the central tower, and a
gibbet erected in front of it. No wonder that the emperor expresses
himself dissatisfied with a &ldquo;prospect&rdquo; of so lugubrious a character.
An English sailor seated on a neighbouring gun, delivers the sentiments
of the day after the plain-spoken fashion of his countrymen.
This design, which is by no means in the artist&rsquo;s usual style, was
etched by him from the design of some one whose name or initials
are not recorded.</p>

<p>The actual circumstance to which the foregoing sketch refers is
related to us by the commander of the <i>Bellerophon</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At daybreak on the 24th of July, we were close off Dartmouth.
Count Bertrand went into the cabin and informed Bonaparte of it,
who came upon deck about half-past four, and remained on the
poop until the ship anchored in Torbay. He talked with admiration
of the coast, saying, &lsquo;You have in that respect a great advantage
over France, which is surrounded by rocks and dangers.&rsquo; On
opening Torbay, he was much struck with the beauty of the scenery,
and exclaimed, &lsquo;What a beautiful country! It very, very much
resembles the bay of Porto Ferrago, in Elba.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_72" href="#Footnote_72"><span class="sp">72</span></a></p>

<p>The same year, and on the same subject, the artist gives us
<i>Boney&rsquo;s Meditations on the Island of St. Helena, or the Devil addressing
the Sun</i>, in which the idea is manifestly borrowed from a design
by James Gillray; <i>The Corsican&rsquo;s Last Trip under the Guidance of
his Good Angel</i> [the devil]; <i>The Genius of France Expounding her
Laws to the Sublime People</i>; and a very admirable and original
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>143</span>
design, <i>The Pedigree of Corporal Violet</i>; all of which are etched from
the designs of other artists.</p>

<p>Hardly was Napoleon despatched to the island prison which was
so shortly to prove his grave, and replaced by the unwieldly Louis,
than the latter came in for his full share of satire. In another of
George Cruikshank&rsquo;s caricatures of the same year, he shows us <i>The
Royal Laundress</i> [Louis the Eighteenth] <i>Washing Boney&rsquo;s Court
Dresses</i>, Napoleon watching the process the while from St. Helena.
&ldquo;Ha, ha!&rdquo; he laughs, &ldquo;such an old woman as <i>you</i> might rub a long
while before they&rsquo;ll be all white, for they are tri-coloured in <i>grain</i>.&rdquo;
Another shows us fat Louis climbing the <i>mât de cocagne</i> (soaped
pole) and clutching the crown of France; he clambers up on the
shoulders of Austria, Russia, and Prussia, his immediate supporter
being England. Napoleon watches his progress from across the
sea; &ldquo;<i>I</i> climbed up,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;twice, without <i>any</i> help.&rdquo; Other
subjects of the year are: <i>Friends in Need</i>, and <i>John&rsquo;s Dream, or
the Prince and Old England for Ever!</i></p>

<p>The repugnance of the Regent to the economical measures which
<span class="sn">1816.<br />Aversion of the Regent to retrenchment.</span>
were forced upon the ministry in 1816 is well-known. The people
complained with every just reason of the pressure of taxes, which
were levied, as they said, upon the industrious, to be squandered in
extravagant salaries, sinecures, and unmerited pensions. They complained
of the large standing army, which the Regent insisted to
be necessary for the maintenance of &ldquo;our position and high character
among the European powers.&rdquo; The prince&rsquo;s aversion to the
popular cry for retrenchment and reform is shown by one of George&rsquo;s
caricatures entitled, <i>Sick of the Property Tax, or Ministerial Influenza</i>,
published by Fores on the 8th of March, 1816, where we
see the ministers vomiting into a huge receptacle labelled
&ldquo;Budget,&rdquo; the matter voided consisting of &ldquo;Standing armies,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Property tax,&rdquo; &ldquo;Increase of salaries,&rdquo; and so on. The gouty,
self-indulgent prince hobbles up to his ministers on a pair of
crutches marked respectively, &ldquo;More economy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Increase of
income.&rdquo; Under his arms he carries bundles of accounts, most of
which relate to his own private expenditure, and are labelled,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>144</span>
&ldquo;Expenses of [Brighton] Pavilion,&rdquo; of &ldquo;Furniture,&rdquo; &ldquo;Drinking
expenses.&rdquo; &ldquo;Aye, this comes,&rdquo; he exclaims, &ldquo;of your cursed pill
economy, which you forced me to take a month back; no one knows
what I have suffered from this economical spasm. I am afraid
we shall all be laid up together.&rdquo; On the table behind him lie the
medicines which have been prescribed for him, certain pills labelled
&ldquo;Petitions against the property tax,&rdquo; and a huge bolus ticketed
&ldquo;economy,&rdquo; &ldquo;to be taken immediately.&rdquo; On the same subject a
month later on is a sketch by an amateur, etched by the artist,
bearing the title of <i>Economical Humbug of 1816, or Saving at the
Spiggot and Letting Out at the Bunghole</i>. From a series of small vats,
&ldquo;Assessed taxes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Property tax,&rdquo; &ldquo;Customs,&rdquo; &ldquo;Excise,&rdquo; and other
streams of &ldquo;supply,&rdquo; are pouring into a huge vat labelled &ldquo;The
Treasury of J. Bull&rsquo;s Vital Spirits.&rdquo; Vansittart, Chancellor of the
Exchequer, is carefully drawing off what he requires into a small
bucket for the &ldquo;Public Service.&rdquo; &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he says to Mr. Bull,
who looks admiringly on, &ldquo;I am not a quibbling pettifogger, I am
a man of my word; for you see I have thrown away the great
<i>war</i> spiggot, and have substituted a small <i>peace</i> one in its stead,
which will cause an unknown saving to you.&rdquo; This is all very
well; but the gouty Regent has also tapped the vat on the other
side, and draws off the supplies in a copious stream into a receptacle
labelled, &ldquo;Deficiencies of the Civil List.&rdquo; His friends and boon
companions are bringing up a fresh supply of empty vessels to be
filled in their turn; one carries a barrel marked, &ldquo;For household
troops and standing army&rdquo;; another is labelled, &ldquo;Sinecures, places,
and pensions&rdquo;; a third, &ldquo;For cottages and pavilions&rdquo;; and a fourth,
&ldquo;£60,000 for fun.&rdquo; &ldquo;Come, my friends,&rdquo; says the prince, &ldquo;make
haste and fill your buckets, whilst Van is keeping noisy Johnny
quiet with fine speeches and promises of economy, which I am
determined not to practise as long as I can get anything to expend;
and while he is saving at the spiggot, we will have it out of the
bunghole.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_73" href="#Footnote_73"><span class="sp">73</span></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>145</span></p>

<p><i>Preparing for the Match, or the 2nd of May, 1816</i>, has reference
to the marriage of the Princess Charlotte of Wales, who, as we
have already seen, was on that day united to Prince Leopold of
Saxe-Coburg. It had been preceded by a well-designed but most
indelicate satire, labelled <i>Royal Nuptials</i>, published by J. Johnstone
on the 1st of April, in which the prince is seen landing on
our shores in a state of destitution, with a pitiable lack of certain
necessary articles of clothing, which are being handed to him by
John Bull in the guise of a countryman. The <i>dramatis personæ</i> are
seven in number: Prince Leopold, John Bull, the Chancellor of
the Exchequer, the gouty Regent, the Princess Charlotte, old
Queen Charlotte, with her snuff-box, and, behind her, an old
woman intended, I believe, for the poor old king himself. The
same year we find two other indelicate subjects: <i>A Bazaar</i>, a skit
upon the immorality and costume of the period, comprising thirty
figures; and another, in allusion to the marriage of the Princess
Mary with her cousin, the Duke of Gloucester, on the 22nd of July,
1816. To those who have asserted that George Cruikshank &ldquo;never
pandered to sensuality ... or raised a laugh at the expense
of decency,&rdquo; that &ldquo;satire in his hands never degenerated into
savagery or scurrility,&rdquo; I would commend the serious consideration
of the three satires I have last named.</p>

<p>At the time Egypt was in the power of the French, during the
<span class="sn">The Elgin Marbles.</span>
early part of the century, Lord Elgin had quitted England upon a
mission to the Ottoman Porte. A great change has taken place
in the attitude and bearing of the Turks towards other European
nations during the last half century; but even at this time the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>146</span>
contempt and dislike which had characterized them in their behaviour
towards every denomination of Christians still prevailed in
full force. The success, however, of the British arms in Egypt, and
the expected restitution of that province to the Porte, seem to have
wrought a wonderful and instantaneous change in the disposition of
that power and its people towards ourselves;<a name="FnAnchor_74" href="#Footnote_74"><span class="sp">74</span></a> and Lord Elgin,
availing himself of these favourable circumstances, obtained in the
summer of 1801, access to the Acropolis of Athens for general
purposes, with a concession to &ldquo;make excavations and to take away
any stones that might appear interesting to himself.&rdquo; The result
(shortly stated) was the excavation of the once celebrated &ldquo;Elgin
marbles,&rdquo; about which, if we are to credit the report from which
we glean this information, his lordship would seem to have expended
(including the interest of capital) some £74,000. The
committee recommend the House, under these circumstances,
coupled with the valuations which they had obtained from competent
authorities, that £35,000 was &ldquo;a reasonable and sufficient
price to be paid for the collection,&rdquo; and their purchase appears to
have been completed on the basis of these figures, a fact which
forms the subject of the artist&rsquo;s undated and admirable satire of <i>John
Bull Buying Stones at the Time his Numerous Family Want Bread</i>.</p>

<p>Unsigned, and under date of 25th of November, 1816, I find a
caricature published by Fores, which seems to me due to the hand
of George Cruikshank. It is entitled, <i>The Nightmayor</i>, &ldquo;painted
by Fuzeley,&rdquo; and represents a debased woman in the stertorous
sleep of drunkenness, whose muddled dream-thoughts revert to
the experiences with which her evil habits have made her so frequently
familiar. The gin drinker has been brought before the
Lord Mayor any number of times for being &ldquo;drunk and disorderly,&rdquo;
and accordingly her <i>nightmare</i> assumes the form of the city official,
who sits upon the body clothed in his robes and invested with
the insignia of his office. Appended to the satire are the following
lines:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>147</span></p>

<p>The only other caricature of George I have to notice under date
of 1816 is entitled, <i>State Physicians Bleeding John Bull to Death</i>. (*)</p>

<p>In our third chapter we referred to the distress which prevailed
<span class="sn">1817.</span>
amongst the industrial classes during the two years which followed
the fall of Bonaparte.<a name="FnAnchor_75" href="#Footnote_75"><span class="sp">75</span></a> We meet with an exceedingly rare pictorial
satire by George Cruikshank, which relates to this state of things;
it bears the title of, <i>John Bull Brought up for a Discharge, but
Remanded on Account of Extravagance and False Schedule</i>, and was
published by Fores on the 29th of March, 1817. John Bull, a
bankrupt, is being publicly examined as to the causes of his
failure: &ldquo;Being desired by the court to give some explanation [on
the subject of the prodigious difference between his debts and his
assets], he said that he had been persuaded originally to join with
some of the parishioners in indicting his neighbour, Mr. Frog, for
keeping a disorderly house; that they had engaged to bear their
part of the expenses, but had all sneaked off one by one, and left
him to pay the whole, and carry on the proceedings. It had at
last, after being moved from one court to another, become a suit
in Chancery; and he had been advised by the gentleman whom
he had always consulted on these matters, and who was now dead,
to go on and persevere, for that he would be sure to get a final
decree in his favour, and all the costs. He had at last, in fact, got a
decree in his favour, about two years since, before Lord Chancellor
Wellington, and for the costs; but not a farthing had ever been paid,
nor was it likely to be; on the contrary, Mr. Frog had surrendered
himself, and gone to prison, where he was now living at this
moment, at his [Mr. Bull&rsquo;s] expense. Besides, the house in question
was now opened again under a new license, granted by the magistrates
of the district ... or rather, a renewal of the old one,
in favour of the brother of the person who had kept it formerly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>148</span>
... and the new landlord had taken down the late sign of
the Bee Hive, and put up the old one of the <i>Fleur-de-lis</i>; but it
was nearly as disorderly as ever, and the magistrates were obliged
to keep up a great number of special constables to preserve the
peace of the neighbourhood.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_76" href="#Footnote_76"><span class="sp">76</span></a></p>

<p>John Bull, in his best blue coat and white waistcoat, and suffering
under an attack of gout is going through the ordeal of his public
examination before the judge. In front of this functionary is the
bankrupt&rsquo;s schedule, on which we read the following items:&mdash;</p>

<table class="nobctr" width="70%" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tc3">&ldquo;Amount of Income</td>  <td class="tc2">£24,000,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tc3">Expenditure</td>  <td class="tc2">80,000,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tc3">Dr. Nick Frog</td>  <td class="tc2">10,000,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tc3">Paul Bruin</td>  <td class="tc2">1,000,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tc3">Frank Force-child</td>  <td class="tc2">8,000,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tc3">Will Eagle Eye</td>  <td class="tc2">6,000,000</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tc3">Ferd. Faithless</td>  <td class="tc2">30,000,000.&rdquo;</td></tr></table>

<p>In the body of the court, and separated from the commissioner
by a wooden enclosure, the upper edge of which is lined with
bayonets pointing inwards, are a number of the bankrupt&rsquo;s wretched
creditors, whom Death, clothed in a red coat and armed with a
mace, vainly strives to keep quiet. &ldquo;Ck. fect.&rdquo; in such faint letters
that they might easily escape detection, is appended to this remarkable
composition.</p>

<p>In our third chapter we also referred to the serious disturbances
which followed and were the consequences of the public discontents
of 1817, and the fact that the names of four informers, Castle,
Oliver, Edwards, and Franklin were identified with those of the
chief fomenters of sedition in the metropolis and the northern
counties.<a name="FnAnchor_77" href="#Footnote_77"><span class="sp">77</span></a> In further illustration of the satires in which these
fellows put in an appearance, we have one by George Cruikshank
(published by Fores on the 1st of July), and labelled, <i>Conspirators,
or Delegates in Council</i>.  We may here mention that on the 9th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>149</span>
of June, one Watson, a surgeon, was tried for high treason at
Westminster Hall, and acquitted on the 16th, whereupon the
Attorney General abandoned the prosecution against Thistlewood,
Preston, and Hooper, who were also indicted under a like
charge. All the accused were in indigent or humble circumstances,
and the chief witness against them appears to have been
Castle. Among the five persons sitting round the table, we recognise
Castle (whose villainous face is turned towards us) and Oliver.
The others we cannot identify. The aristocratic looking gentleman
receiving them so blandly is my Lord Castlereagh. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
think, my lord,&rdquo; says the person next him, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that
our friends Castle and Oliver should be sent to Lisbon or somewhere,
as consul-generals or envoys?&rdquo; &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; says his lordship
to the beetle-browed ruffians by way of rejoinder, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you
<i>negotiate</i> for some boroughs?&rdquo; John Bull, looking through the
window at these negotiations, with much indignation, and recognising
in these fellows the rascals by whom he has been &ldquo;ensnared
into [committing] criminal acts,&rdquo; hints in very plain terms that the
conduct pursued by such men was the high road to political favour
in 1817. Among the papers on the table we notice a &ldquo;Plan for
the attack on the Regent&rsquo;s carriage;&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_78" href="#Footnote_78"><span class="sp">78</span></a> a bundle of &ldquo;treasonable
papers to be slipped into the pockets of some duped artisans;&rdquo;
another, indicating the &ldquo;means to be taken to implicate Sir Francis
Burdett, Lord Cochrane,&rdquo; and other popular agitators of that day;
&ldquo;A list of victims in Ireland,&rdquo; and so on. On the floor at his
lordship&rsquo;s feet lie some of the tri-coloured flags unfurled at the
Spafields meeting; the obvious inference intended to be conveyed
being of course that the Government were really at the bottom of
the popular disturbances.</p>

<p><i>R-y-l Condescension, or a Foreign Minister Astonished</i>, published
by Fores on the 15th of September, 1817, is one of George Cruikshank&rsquo;s
most finished but at the same time indelicate compositions.
It refers to the rumours affecting the Princess Caroline&rsquo;s reputation
which preceded the &ldquo;bill of pains and penalties,&rdquo; to which we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>150</span>
have already alluded. It appears to us to have originated out of
the following circumstance. It was asserted that at a masked ball
which the princess had given shortly after she left England to the
then King of Naples, Joachim Murat, she appeared in three different
disguises; that in one of these, &ldquo;The Genius of History,&rdquo; she had
appeared in so unclothed a state as to call for particular observation;
her third disguise was a Turkish costume. It was further asserted
that in her changes of dress she had been assisted, not by her
female attendants, but by the person with whom her name was so
familiarly associated. In the sketch before us, Her Royal Highness&rsquo;s
corpulent and redundant figure is clothed in a tight-fitting
Turkish dress and trousers, her head being covered by a ponderous
turban. The five figures composing her &ldquo;suite&rdquo; are the Courier
Bartolomeo Bergami, his brothers Louis and Vollotti Bergami, his
sister, and William Austin, the youth she had adopted,<a name="FnAnchor_79" href="#Footnote_79"><span class="sp">79</span></a> and who,
it was proved, slept in her bed-chamber. The whole are decorated
with the crosses and ribbons of the absurd order which she was
said to have instituted. The courtly, well dressed foreign gentleman
to whom she is introducing these vulgar persons appears to
be intended for Metternich, who, while thanking Her Royal Highness
for her &ldquo;condescension,&rdquo; looks the very picture of unfeigned
but well-bred astonishment.</p>

<p>In the evening of the 18th of November, 1817, a mournful procession,
<span class="sn">Death of Princess Charlotte.</span>
at which all the great officers of state attended, quitted
Claremont House <i>en route</i> for Windsor. At the impressive ceremony
which followed, Garter King at Arms proclaimed its melancholy
purport in the following words: &ldquo;Thus it has pleased
Almighty God to take out of this transitory life, unto His Divine
mercy, the late most illustrious Princess Charlotte Augusta, daughter
of His Royal Highness, George, Prince of Wales, Regent of the
United Kingdom.&rdquo; It was even so. The pride and hope of the
nation, the heiress of the crown, was on the 6th of November
delivered of a still-born child, and within a very few hours afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>151</span>
had succumbed to the unlooked-for and fatal exhaustion which
followed. The grief which this occasioned was so universal that
every one seemed to realize the fact that he or she had sustained
an individual loss; scarcely perhaps in English history had the
death of a member of a royal family been more sincerely and
truly regretted. The mournful event is referred to by the artist
in a more than usually touching sketch, entitled, <i>England&rsquo;s Hope
Departing</i>. Among the medical attendants of Her Royal Highness
who followed her to the grave, was the accoucheur, Sir
Richard Croft, Bart. This distinguished gentleman was so deeply
affected with the unlooked-for result, that his mind refused to
recover its tone, and within a month afterwards he committed
self-destruction.</p>

<p>Other pictorial satires of George Cruikshank, bearing the date of
1817, are: <i>Fashionables of 1817</i>, two figures&mdash;a male and female&mdash;outrageously
caricatured, a rough affair, altogether differing from his
usual style; the well-known <i>double entendre</i>, <i>A View of the Regent&rsquo;s
Bomb</i>, which, with our knowledge of his sensitiveness on the subject
of his personal appearance, must have given the exalted personage
thus outrageously satirized the greatest possible mortification; <i>The
Spa Fields Orator Hunting for Popularity to do Good</i>, (*) a punning
satire on &ldquo;Orator&rdquo; Hunt; <i>A Patriot Luminary Extinguishing
Noxious Gas</i> (etched from the design of another artist); and two
admirable designs bearing the titles of <i>Vis-à-Vis</i> and <i>Les Graces</i>.
The same year we meet with one of the earliest of his alliterative
satires, afterwards so frequently to be seen among the famous illustrations
to the &ldquo;Comic Almanack&rdquo;: <i>La Belle Assemblée, or Sketches
of Characteristic Dancing</i>, miscellaneous groups, comprising in all
thirty figures (exclusive of the orchestra), engaged in a country
dance, a Scotch reel, an Irish jig, a minuet, the German waltz,
a French quadrille, the Spanish bolero, and a ballet &ldquo;Italienne.&rdquo;
The walls are hung with pictures of dancing dogs, a dancing
bear, a dancing horse, rope dancing, the dance of St. Vitus,
and &ldquo;Dancing Mad.&rdquo; Besides this, we find the same year two large
sheets showing the <i>Striking Effects produced by Lines and Dots,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>152</span>
for the Assistance of every Draughtsman</i>, suggested by, but a very
vast improvement on, G. M. Woodward&rsquo;s <i>Multum in Parvo, or
Liliputian Sketches, showing what may be done by Lines and Dots</i>.</p>

<p>A report of the House of Commons, showing how four million
<span class="sn">1818.<br />Adulteration of Tea.</span>
pounds weight of sloe, liquorice, and ash-tree leaves were annually
mixed with Chinese teas in England, was supplemented by a trial in
the Court of Exchequer, in which a grocer named Palmer was fined
in £840 penalties, for the fabrication of spurious tea. It appeared
that there was a regular manufactory of imitation tea in Goldstone
Street, which was composed of thorn leaves, which, after passing
through a peculiar process, were coloured with logwood; the same
leaves, after being pressed and dried, were laid upon sheets of
copper, coloured with verdigris and Dutch pink, and sold as <i>green</i>
tea. These revelations led, in 1818, to the artist&rsquo;s admirable caricature
of <i>The T Trade in Hot-water, or a Pretty Kettle of Fish: dedicated
to J. Canister and T. Spoon, Esquires</i>. Besides these, we have the
same year: <i>An Interesting Scene on Board an East Indian</i>, a very
coarse but admirable performance; <i>Introduction to the Gout</i> (a fiend
dropping a hot coal on the toe of a <i>bon vivant</i>); <i>A Fine Lady, or the
Incomparable</i>, in which it appears to us that Robert had a hand;
<i>Les Savoyards</i> and <i>Le Palais Royal de Paris</i>; <i>Comparative Anatomy,
or the Dandy Trio</i>; and <i>The Art of Walking the Streets of London</i>,
eight subjects, etched by the artist after the design of George
Moutard Woodward.</p>

<p>On the 4th of December, 1818, the number of convicts lying
under sentence of death in his Majesty&rsquo;s gaol of Newgate, amounted
to no less than sixty, of whom ten were females; probably not
three of these unfortunate beings would have been hung now-a-days.
Under the Draconian laws, however, then in force, people were hung
in scores for passing forged one-pound Bank of England notes;
and this barbarous state of things, disgraceful to a Christian country,
led to the famous and telling satire of the <i>Bank Restriction Note</i>,
one of the very few which seem to have escaped oblivion, and which,
having been repeated and reproduced in all the latest essays which
have been written on him, calls for no extra description from ourselves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>153</span>
It is said to have had the effect desired, and that &ldquo;no
man or woman was ever hanged after this for passing forged one-pound
Bank of England notes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1819 we have one of George Cruikshank&rsquo;s severe and telling
<span class="sn">1819.</span>
attacks upon the Prince Regent, in <i>Sales by Auction, or Provident
Children disposing of their Deceased Mother&rsquo;s Effects for the Benefit of
the Creditors</i> (*), in which he shows us the prince knocking down (in
his character of auctioneer) his dead mother&rsquo;s old hats, gowns, and
clothing, and begging the bystanders to bid liberally. At the foot of
the rostrum lie sundry snuff-boxes and pots, labelled &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s
Mixture&rdquo; and &ldquo;Prince&rsquo;s Mixture&rdquo; (in allusion to the old queen&rsquo;s
habits), &ldquo;Strasburg&rdquo; (in reference to her German tastes and nationality),
together with her old china tea-set.</p>

<p>This year is remarkable for producing perhaps the most ambitious
and admirable allegory which the artist ever designed; it bears the
title of <i>Old Thirty-nine Shaking Hands with his Good Brother the
Pope of Italy, or Covering Up</i> versus <i>Sealing the Bible</i>. Old Thirty-nine
(an English bishop) stands on a pile of volumes labelled, &ldquo;Never-out-ism,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ante-biblism,&rdquo; &ldquo;Never-the-same-ism,&rdquo; etc., whilst the pope,
standing on the opposite side on a mass of books bearing similar
suggestive titles, shakes hands with his &ldquo;good brother.&rdquo; By the
pope&rsquo;s side we find the devil busily engaged in sealing up the Bible.
Behind him stands the Temple of Mammon, surrounded by a
crowd of reverend worshippers. Two fiends standing by the side
of &ldquo;Old Thirty-nine&rdquo; make preparations for a bonfire, to which
sundry bundles labelled, &ldquo;Articles of Faith,&rdquo; &ldquo;Athanasian Creed,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Catechism,&rdquo; &ldquo;Liturgies,&rdquo; &ldquo;Nicene Creed,&rdquo; and so on, will contribute
materials. Out of a building in the rear, inscribed, &ldquo;National
School for Thirty-niners only,&rdquo; issues a procession of ecclesiastics
and beadles carrying banners. In the foreground stands the figure
of &ldquo;Divine Truth,&rdquo; surrounded by little children, and perusing the
pages of the &ldquo;Holy Bible,&rdquo; held for that purpose by an angel. A
roughly executed affair in two compartments, <i>Preachee and Floggee Too</i>,
satirizes certain clerical magistrates who, while preaching mercy and
forgiveness in the pulpit, distinguish themselves by the severity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>154</span>
their sentences for minor offences on the magisterial bench. The
titles of other subjects of the year are: <i>The Hobby Horse Dealer</i>;
<i>Johnny Bull and his Forged Notes, or Rags and Ruin in the Paper
Currency</i>; <i>Smoke Jack, the Alarmist, Extinguishing the Second Great
Fire of London</i>; <i>Love, Law, and Physic</i> (*); <i>The Sailor&rsquo;s Progress</i>
(six subjects); <i>Dandies in France, or Le Restorateur</i> (*); <i>A Match
for the King&rsquo;s Plate</i>; <i>The Belle Alliance, or the Female Reformers of
Blackburn</i> (*); <i>Voila t&rsquo;on mort</i>; and <i>Royal Red Bengal Tiger</i> (etched
from the designs of other artists); <i>Irish Decency</i> (two caricatures);

maugre Sharks of the Day</i> (*).</p>

<p>An unsigned caricature, published by Fores on the 15th of May,
1819, appears to me to be due to the hand of George Cruikshank.
It bears the title of <i>The Dandy Tailor Planning a New Hungry
Dress</i>, and would appear to have reference to some contemplated
introduction of foreign mercenaries into the English service. The
tailor, while stitching a military jacket, sings a song of which the
following is a verse,&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;A tailor there was, and he lived in a stall,</p>
<p class="i05">Which served him for palace, for kitchen, and hall.</p>
<p class="i05">No coin in his pocket, no nous in his pate,</p>
<p class="i05">No ambition has he, nor no wish to be great.</p>

<p class="noind">A foreigner enters in military costume, introducing two foreign
mercenaries. &ldquo;Dese men,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;will teach you de proper vay

des grands mustaches. No more English soldats.&rdquo; A military figure
in jack boots, standing by the side of the tailor, holds the &ldquo;goose&rdquo;
in readiness for his master&rsquo;s use. The Prince Regent, especially as
George the Fourth, was fond of inventing new military costumes, and
Mr. Greville describes him in 1829 (the year before his death) as
&ldquo;employed in devising a new dress for the guards;&rdquo; but by the
mitre at his back, and the reference to his impecunious position, I
should take this &ldquo;tailor&rdquo; to be intended for the Duke of York.</p>

<p><i>Ah! sure such a pair was never seen, so justly formed to meet by
nature!</i><span class="sn">1820.</span> (*) represents a couple of pears, in which we recognise likenesses
of George the Fourth and Queen Caroline, the features of
the king being expressive of strong disgust. After Lord Liverpool
had decided not to send the &ldquo;Bill of Pains and Penalties&rdquo; to the
Commons, for the reason stated in a previous chapter, the Lord
Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council of the City of London
distinguished themselves by presenting, on the 10th of December,
an address to their &ldquo;most gracious sovereign,&rdquo; complaining of things
in general, and of public expenditure in particular, the real cause
of complaint, however, being &ldquo;the alleged criminality&rdquo; which, as
the petitioners stated, had been &ldquo;falsely ascribed&rdquo; to the queen.
This address, which was conceived in the worst possible taste,
concluded with the following outrageous prayer: &ldquo;We therefore
humbly pray your Majesty to dismiss from your presence and
councils for ever those ministers whose pernicious measures have
so long endangered the throne, undermined the constitution, and
blighted the prosperity of the nation.&rdquo; Now, only fancy any Corporation
of London in our time signalizing itself by presenting a
petition to &ldquo;Her Most Gracious Majesty,&rdquo; complaining of the
measures of Lord Beaconsfield or Mr. Gladstone, and praying her
to dismiss them from her councils! The king returned the following
answer: &ldquo;It has been with the most painful feelings that I
have heard the sentiments contained in the address and petition
now presented to me by the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common
Council of the City of London. Whatever may be the motives of
those by whom it is brought forward, its evident tendency is to
inflame the passions and mislead the judgment of the unwary and
less enlightened part of my subjects, and thus to aggravate all the
difficulties with which we have to contend.&rdquo; This episode suggested
to George one of the most admirable of his caricatures: <i>A Scene in
the New Farce as performed at the Royalty Theatre</i>. The corpulent
monarch, in the character and costume of Henry the Eighth, is
receiving a number of deputations from all parts of England,
Scotland, and Ireland, bearing petitions praying him to dismiss his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>156</span>
ministry, the members of which stand on each side of the throne,
one of the number being habited as a jester. This exceedingly
rare plate carries on it the following explanation: &ldquo;King Henry
VIII. being petitioned to dismiss his ministers and council by the
citizens of London and many boroughs, to relieve his oppressed
subjects, made the citizens this sagacious reply: &lsquo;We, with all our
cabinet, think it strange that ye who be but <i>brutes</i> and inexpert folk,
should tell us who be and who be not fit for our council.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another of George Cruikshank&rsquo;s rare and valuable contributions
<span class="sn">1821.</span>
to the Queen Caroline series of pictorial satires is labelled <i>The Royal
Rushlight</i>, which many people (among them the Chancellor and
corpulent George) are vainly endeavouring to blow out. By way
(it may be) of contrast, this excellent satire has appended to it the
following miserable doggerel,&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>

<p>&ldquo;Cook, coachee, men and maids, very nearly all in buff,</p>

<p>With the year 1821 came the closing scene in the drama of
<span class="sn">Death of Queen Caroline.</span>
Caroline&rsquo;s unhappy but singularly undignified career. On the
occasion of the king&rsquo;s coronation she had applied to Lord
Liverpool, desiring to be informed what arrangements had been
made for her convenience, and who were appointed her attendants
at the approaching ceremony. An answer was returned that, &ldquo;it
was a right of the Crown to give or withhold the order for her
Majesty&rsquo;s coronation, and that his Majesty would be advised not to
give any directions for her participation in the arrangements;&rdquo; but
with the obstinacy of purpose which was so fatal a blemish in her
character, and which seems to have been the primary cause of all
her misfortunes, she insisted on her right, and declared moreover
her firm intention of attending the ceremony. A respectful but
peremptory reply was returned, reasserting the legal prerogative of
the Crown, and announcing that the former intimation must be
understood as amounting to a <i>prohibition</i> of her attendance. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>157</span>
was however so ill-advised as to present herself early on the morning
of the day (the 19th of July) at the doors of the Abbey of Westminster.
The door-keepers refused to allow her to enter as queen;
and she was forced to submit to the mortification of having to retire
without having succeeded (as it was her evident intention to have
done) in marring the arrangements for the splendid ceremony.
By this time the enthusiasm in her favour had greatly evaporated,
and she was received even coldly by her friends the assembled mob.
The mortification proved fatal to her; very shortly afterwards she
was taken ill, and died in less than three weeks after the unnecessary
mortification to which she had thus insisted on exposing herself.</p>

<p>It is probable that if the wishes of her executors had been allowed
to be carried out, the unfortunate woman would have been carried to
her grave in peace. She had directed that her remains should, three
days after her death, be carried to Brunswick for interment; and
had Lord Liverpool been wise, he would have left the executors to
carry out the arrangements after their own fashion. Unfortunately,
the Government decided to take the arrangements into their own
hands, and to lay down the route (the shortest) by which the
mournful procession should proceed to Harwich. No fault can be
found with the arrangements themselves, which were intended to pay
the greatest respect to the memory of the deceased; but the cautions
they took brought about the very result they were anxious to avoid,
and at once revived all the slumbering sympathies of the mob in
favour of the unhappy queen. A squabble took place at the outset,
Dr. Lushington, as one of the executors, protesting against the
removal of the corpse; but, escorted by squadrons of Horse-guards
Blue, the procession left Brandenburg House at eight o&rsquo;clock in the
morning of the 15th of August, in a drizzling rain. The cavalcade
reached Kensington in solemn order; but on arriving at the Gravel
Pits, and attempting to turn off to the left, its progress was instantly
blocked by wagons and carts placed across the road, while a body of
men formed across the streets twenty deep and evinced every
disposition to dispute the passage. A severe conflict took place
between them and the constables, several on both sides being hurt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>158</span>
For an hour and a half the procession waited for orders, and at
length it moved towards London. On reaching Kensington Gore a
squadron of the Life Guards, with a magistrate at their head, tried in
vain to open the park gates, the crowd vociferating in the meantime,
&ldquo;To the city! the city!&rdquo; On reaching Hyde Park Corner,
the gate there was found barricaded with carts, and the procession
then moved on to Park Lane, which being also blocked up, it turned
back hastily and entered Hyde Park, through which it proceeded at
a trot, the soldiers having cleared away the obstacles at the gate.
On reaching Cumberland Gate, it was found closed by the populace,
and in the conflict which ensued the park wall was thrown down by
the pressure of the crowd, who hurled the stones at the soldiers, in
return for the use the latter had made of their sabres in clearing the
passage. Many of the military and their horses were hurt; and
some of the soldiers, irritated by their rough usage, resorted to their
pistols and carbines, and two persons (Richard Honey, a carpenter,
and George Francis, a bricklayer) were unfortunately killed, and
others wounded. The Edgeware Road was blockaded, but quickly
cleared, and the procession moved on till it arrived at the turnpike
gate near the top of Tottenham Court Road. There the mob made
so determined a stand that further opposition was deemed unadvisable,
and the popular will being at length acceded to, the cavalcade
forthwith took its way into the city. Every street through which a
turn could have been made in order to enter the New Road or the
City Road was found barricaded. As the funeral passed through
the city, the Oxford Blues doing duty there, who had not participated
in the outrage, were cordially greeted by the populace on
either side of the street. The inquests on the bodies of the dead
men lasted for a considerable period. In the case of Francis, a
verdict of &ldquo;wilful murder against a life guardsman unknown&rdquo; was
returned; whilst in that of Honey, the verdict was manslaughter
against the officers and men of the first regiment of Life Guards on
duty at the time. This event is recorded by George in a caricature
entitled, <i>The Manslaughter Men, or a Horse Laugh at the Law of
the Land</i>,&mdash;two ghostly gory figures rising from their graves, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>159</span>
are respectively inscribed, &ldquo;Verdict, wilful murder,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Verdict,
manslaughter&rdquo;; a group of life guardsmen grin and point at the
body, and one of them jeeringly remarks, &ldquo;Shake not thy bloody
locks at me; ye cannot say who did it.&rdquo; Another satire on the same
subject bears the title of <i>The Horse Chancellor obtaining a Verdict,
or Killing no Murder</i>.</p>

<p>Other subjects of this year are the following: <i>And when Ahitophel
saw that his Counsel was not followed, he Saddled his Ass, and
arose and went and Hanged himself</i>; <i>O! O! there&rsquo;s a Minister of the
Gospel</i>; <i>The Royal Extinguisher, or the King of Brobdingnag and
the Liliputians</i> (etched after the design of Isaac Robert). Six
subjects, <i>La Diligence</i> and <i>La Doriane</i>, <i>Venus de Medici and Mer de
Glace</i>, <i>Visit to Vesuvius</i> and <i>Forum Boarium</i>, and <i>Nosing the Nob at
Ramsgate</i>, a coarsely executed satire aimed at his Majesty and his
eccentric subject, Alderman Sir William Curtis.</p>

<p>Sir William Curtis, alderman, trader, and formerly member for the
<span class="sn">1822.<br />Sir William Curtis.</span>
city, is one of the most prominent figures in the satires of his time.
Making every allowance for caricature drawing, the likeness must
have been on the whole a faithful though an exaggerated one; for
in all the numerous comical sketches in which he makes an appearance,
we never fail to recognise his ruby nose and ponderous figure.
We have already seen him figuring by way of ludicrous contrast with
Claude Ambroise Seurat, the &ldquo;living skeleton,&rdquo; and we shall now
find him associated by the caricaturists with no less a person than
the king himself. When his majesty, in 1822, paid his visit to
Scotland, and by way of compliment to the country and her traditions
assumed the &ldquo;garb of old Gael,&rdquo; Alderman Sir William
Curtis, who followed his sovereign at a respectful distance, out of
compliment to the country, her traditions, &ldquo;his most gracious
majesty,&rdquo; and himself, put his own corpulent form into fancy
costume, and likewise donned the Highland garb. The absurdly
ludicrous result is told us by Lockhart. &ldquo;The king at his first levee
diverted many, and delighted Scott by appearing in the full Highland
garb&mdash;the same brilliant <i>Stewart tartans</i>, so-called, in which
certainly no Stewart, except Prince Charles, had ever before presented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>160</span>
himself in the saloons of Holyrood. His majesty&rsquo;s Celtic
toilette had been carefully watched and assisted by the gallant Laird
of Garth, who was not a little proud of the result of his dexterous
manipulations of the rough plaid, and pronounced the king &lsquo;a vara
pretty man.&rsquo; And he did look a most stately and imposing person
in that beautiful dress; but his satisfaction therein was cruelly
disturbed when he discovered, towering and blazing among and
above the genuine Glengarries and Macleods and MacGregors, a
figure even more portly than his own, equipped from a sudden impulse
of loyal ardour in an equally complete set of the self-same
conspicuous Stewart tartans:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">In truth this portentous apparition cast an air of ridicule and caricature
over the whole of Sir Walter&rsquo;s celtified pageantry. A sharp
little bailie from Aberdeen, who had previously made acquaintance
with the worthy Guildhall baronet, and tasted the turtle soup of his
voluptuous yacht, tortured him as he sailed down the long gallery of
Holyrood, by suggesting that after all his costume was not quite
perfect. Sir William, who had been rigged out, as the auctioneer&rsquo;s
advertisements say, &lsquo;regardless of expense,&rsquo; exclaimed that he must
be mistaken, begged he would explain his criticism, and, as he spoke,
threw a glance of admiration on his <i>skene dhu</i> (black knife), which,
like a true &lsquo;warrior and hunter of deer,&rsquo; he wore stuck into one of
his garters. &lsquo;Oo ay! Oo ay!&rsquo; quoth the Aberdonian; &lsquo;the knife&rsquo;s a&rsquo;
right, mon&mdash;but faar&rsquo;s your speen?&rsquo; (where&rsquo;s your spoon?) Such
was Scott&rsquo;s story; but whether he &lsquo;gave it a cocked hat and walking
cane,&rsquo; in the hope of restoring the king&rsquo;s good humour, so grievously
shaken by this heroical <i>doppel ganger</i>, it is not very necessary to
inquire.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_81" href="#Footnote_81"><span class="sp">81</span></a></p>

<p>Which indeed of the absurd pair looked the most ridiculous it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>161</span>
would be hard to say: a great-grandson of George the Second in
the Highland garb of &ldquo;Bonnie Prince Charlie,&rdquo; was perhaps as
absurd an anachronism as a fat cockney alderman in the same fancy
costume. Our friends the caricaturists were fully alive to these
puerilities. An anonymous caricature of the day celebrates the
ludicrous event in a satire entitled, <i>Equipt for a Northern Visit</i>,
which represents the fat king and the fat alderman in kilts, the point
of the pictorial epigram lying in the fact that the corpulent king
recommends his corpulent subject to lay aside the costume as unbecoming
to a man of <i>his</i> proportions. George has several pictorial
satires on the same fertile theme; one of these, <i>Bonnie Willie</i>,
depicts the huge man in Highland garb. A rare and most amusing
caricature shows us the supposed unfortunate <i>Results of this Northern
Excursion</i>. The fat king and his fat subject have caught the
northern complaint vulgarly termed the &ldquo;Scottish fiddle,&rdquo; and are
vigorously going through the traditionary process of rubbing
themselves against the post, blessing the while his grace the Duke
of Argyle. An English acquaintance, not unnaturally afraid of
infection, refuses the alderman&rsquo;s proffered hand.</p>

<p>A caricature of altogether another kind commemorates a raid
made by the Bow Street officers on the numerous gaming establishments
of 1822. It is called, <i>Cribbage, Shuffling, Whist, and a
Round Game</i>, is divided into six compartments, and is most
humorously and admirably treated. The principal performers are
the knaves of cards. One of the compartments shows us the
knaves on the treadmill, which is marked &ldquo;Fortune&rsquo;s Wheel;&rdquo;
while in another a knave is undergoing the discipline of the &ldquo;cat,&rdquo;
and calling out at every stroke &ldquo;E. O.! E. O.! E. O.!&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_82" href="#Footnote_82"><span class="sp">82</span></a></p>

<p>Sir Richard Westmacott&rsquo;s statue of Achilles was executed in 1822.
<span class="sn">Statue of Achilles.</span>
The nude, undraped colossal figure, which was subscribed for by the
ladies of England in honour of the Duke of Wellington and his
soldiers, was the occasion of numerous contemporary satires&mdash;most
of them (in those plain-spoken days) of the broadest possible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>162</span>
character. One of the most indelicate (*) (drawn by the artist from
the sketch or suggestion of another) gives a burlesque front and
back view of the figure, which is surrounded by a number of people
(principally ladies), among whom we recognise a caricature likeness
of the &ldquo;Dook.&rdquo; The inscription runs as follows: &ldquo;To Arthur à
Bradley, and his jolly companions every one, this brazen image of
Patrick O&rsquo;Killus, Esq., is inscribed by their countrywomen.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_83" href="#Footnote_83"><span class="sp">83</span></a>
Besides the foregoing, we meet this year with <i>A Lollipop-Ally Campagne
and Brandy Ball</i> (*); <i>Premium, Par, and Discount</i>; <i>Showing-off&mdash;Bang
up&mdash;Prime</i> (*); and <i>A Sailor&rsquo;s description of a Chase
and Capture</i> (*).</p>

<p>A large proportion of his satires for 1823 are aimed at Louis the
<span class="sn">1823.</span>
Eighteenth&rsquo;s Spanish expedition, the object of which we have
already related. One of these shows us <i>France the great Nation
driven by the North into the South</i>; in another, Ferdinand the
Seventh and the Duc d&rsquo;Angoulème figure respectively as a <i>Spanish
Mule and a French Jackass</i>; <i>A French Hilt on a Spanish Rapier</i>, is
likewise dedicated to the Duc d&rsquo;Angoulème; another shows us <i>Old
Bumblehead the 18th trying on Napoleon&rsquo;s Boots</i>; a fifth is entitled,
<i>A Hint to the Blind and Foolish, or the Bourbon Dynasty in Danger</i>;
while a sixth shows us <i>Louis the Fat troubled with Nightmare and
Dreams of Terror</i>. In all these caricatures, the figure of Napoleon,
already sleeping his last sleep at St. Helena&mdash;the place of his exile
and of his grave&mdash;is represented by way of contrast to the unwieldly
and incompetent Bourbon. Another caricature, the point of which
I fail to see, bears the title of <i>The Tables Turn&rsquo;d, or the Devil Outwitted
and Cruelly Punished,&mdash;a Scene on the Portsmouth Treadmill</i>;
this last, though said to be &ldquo;designed by an amateur,&rdquo; and &ldquo;etched
by G. Ck.,&rdquo; is unquestionably all his own.</p>

<p><i>Drilling One-tenth of the Military in the Manual Exercise</i>, and
<span class="sn">1824.</span>
<i>Saint Shela</i> (two subjects), have reference to the Tenth Hussars and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>163</span>
Battier scandal, mentioned in a previous chapter;<a name="FnAnchor_84" href="#Footnote_84"><span class="sp">84</span></a> other subjects of
1824 are: <i>Parisian Luxury</i> (a man being shaved in a bath); <i>Preparing
for a Duel</i>; and <i>The Ostend Packet in a Squall</i>; all etched
by George from the designs of other artists. The mania for joint-stock
companies in 1825, was scarcely equalled by the speculation
mania which inaugurated the passing in our own time of the &ldquo;Limited
Liability Act.&rdquo; In 1824 and the beginning of 1825, two hundred
and seventy-six companies had been projected, of which the aggregate
capital (on paper only) represented £174,114,050. Thirty-three
of these were established for the construction of canals and
docks, forty-eight of railroads, forty-two for the supply of gas, six
of milk, and eight of water, four for the working of coal, and thirty-four
of metal mines; twenty new insurance companies were started,
twenty-three banks, twelve navigation and packet companies, three
fisheries, two for boring tunnels under the Thames, three for the embellishment
and improvement of the metropolis, two for sea-water
baths, and the rest for miscellaneous purposes; it is a somewhat
significant fact that two only had for their object the establishment
of newspapers. Notwithstanding the manifest absurdity of many
of these projects, the shares of several&mdash;especially of the mining
adventurers in South America&mdash;rose to enormous premiums. Among
the last may be mentioned those of the Real del Monte, the price of
which, between the 10th of December and the 11th of January,
rose from £550 to £1350, and the United Mexican during the
same period from £35 to £1550. On these last shares only £10
had been paid, and on the former only £70. Speaking of this
mania, the Rev. T. F. Dibdin (in his &ldquo;Reminiscences&rdquo;) says, &ldquo;If it
did not partake of the name, it had certainly all the wild characteristics
of the South Sea Bubble. To-day you had only to put your
name down to a share or shares in the Rio de la Plata or other South
American mines, and to-morrow a supplicant purchaser would give
you fifty per cent. for every share taken. The old were bewitched ... the
young were in ecstasies. Everybody made a rush for the
city. A new world of wealth had been discovered. It was only to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>164</span>
ask and have.&rdquo; George Cruikshank refers to this state of things in
a caricature called, <i>A Scene in the Farce of Lofty Projects, as Performed
with great success for the benefit and amusement of John Bull</i>.
Besides these, he gives us <i>The Four Mr. Prices</i> (High Price, Low
Price, Full Price, and Half Price).</p>

<p>I can assign no date to <i>Waiting on the Ladies</i>; <i>The Death of the
Property Tax, or Thirty-seven Mortal Wounds for Ministers and the
Inquisitorial Commissioners</i>; or to <i>The Court at Brighton, à la Chinese</i>,
one of the most admirable of the whole series. In this last,
the fat prince habited as a mandarin, is seated on a sofa between
the Princess Charlotte and an enormously fat woman, probably
intended for the Marchioness of Conyngham. He is handing to a
Chinese official a paper inscribed &ldquo;Instructions for Lord Amhurst,
to get fresh patterns of Chinese deformities to finish the decorations
of Pavilion G. P. R.&rdquo; A specimen of regency taste and sympathies
stands on a pedestal in the form of the Hottentot Venus,
while a statuette of the fat prince himself, habited in a red coat,
white waistcoat, yellow inexpressibles, and silk stockings, is labelled
the &ldquo;British Adonis.&rdquo; The princess recommends her papa to order
the officer to bring her over &ldquo;a Chinaman, instead of getting her a
husband among our German cousins.&rdquo; A variety of miscellaneous
articles are strewn about the floor, among them a box containing
the Regent&rsquo;s wigs and whiskers, a treatise on &ldquo;The Art of making
Punch,&rdquo; the indispensable hamper of champagne, and a pair of
curling irons; while no one will fail to recognise the interior of the
Brighton Pavilion as the scene where this admirable satire is laid.
Another undated satire remains to be noticed: it represents a young
man in a boat with three young women, one of them of considerable
personal attractions, that is to say from a Cruikshankian point of
view, and evidently a likeness. On the shore stands another young
woman and her child, whom the young spark has evidently left
behind him. In the stern of the boat is a hamper of wine and a
goblet fashioned out of a skull; a noseless man rows the boat, while
three sailors in an adjoining vessel make ribald observations in
reference to the young man&rsquo;s female companions. By the star on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>165</span>
his coat, the turned-down collar, profile, and the arrangement of the
hair, we take it that the person thus satirized is Lord Byron. Any
doubts we may have on the subject seem removed by the words of
the song he is supposed to be singing while waving his hat to the
disconsolate woman on the shore:&mdash;</p>

<p>The foregoing contains a list and description of some of George
Cruikshank&rsquo;s graphic satires, many of which we have reason to
believe will be entirely new to the great majority of our readers.
They support the description given of him by Lockhart at the
opening of our chapter: &ldquo;People consider him as a clever, sharp
caricaturist, and nothing more&mdash;a free-handed, comical young fellow,
who will do anything he is paid for, and who is quite content to dine
off the proceeds of a &lsquo;George IV.&rsquo; to-day, and those of a &lsquo;Hone,&rsquo;
or a &lsquo;Cobbett,&rsquo; to-morrow.&rdquo; It must be remembered that these
represent but a branch of his work; and that while content to design
a satire as elaborate and as admirable as any which owe their origin
to the hand of Gillray, or to dash off a rough and carelessly executed
caricature, he was equally ready to etch the work of an inferior artist,
or even of an amateur; to execute a drawing on wood for a ballad,
or for one of the numerous political hits of the day, whether on the
loyal or the popular side mattered but little to him; to do anything,
in fact (to use the words of Lockhart), that &ldquo;was suggested or
thrown in his way.&rdquo; It is barely possible that the very imperfect
series we have given may astonish those who have hitherto regarded
George Cruikshank only as an illustrator of books, and supposed
that, with the exception of the woodcuts for Hone&rsquo;s various <i>jeux
d&rsquo;esprits</i>, and the rough work which appears in &ldquo;The Satirist,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>166</span>
Scourge,&rdquo; and publications of a similar character, he executed but
few pictorial satires. A perfect set of impressions from his caricatures
probably does not exist; if it did it would command a high
price indeed. We have seen a set of about seventy plates advertised
by one enterprising bookseller at the price of seventy pounds. The
specimens we have cited (exclusive of two from &ldquo;The Scourge&rdquo;)
128 in number, were published between the years 1808 and 1825,
by G. and H. Humphrey, S. Fairburn, Thomas Tegg, Ackermann,
M. Jones, J. Fairburn, J. Dolby, W. Hone, S. W. Fores, A. Bengo,
J. Sidebotham, S. Knight, and J. Johnstone. If to the foregoing
we add the plates in &ldquo;Cruikshankiana&rdquo;&mdash;twenty-six in number,
thirty in &ldquo;The Scourge,&rdquo; six in &ldquo;Fashion,&rdquo; nine in &ldquo;The Satirist,&rdquo;
and eight in the &ldquo;Loyalists&rsquo; Magazine,&rdquo; we get seventy-nine more,
making a sum total of over two hundred in all. How many more
have escaped notice&mdash;how many have disappeared for ever from
public notice without a chance of recovery or revival&mdash;it would be,
perhaps, impossible to say; for even George himself was sometimes
at fault, when the long-forgotten work of his early years was presented
to him for recognition or acknowledgment.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<h5><i>GEORGE CRUIKSHANK AT HIS PRIME.</i></h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Those</span> who have studied the work of George Cruikshank from its
<span class="sn">Alterations in Cruikshank&rsquo;s Style.</span>
commencement to its close (and those only can be said to have
done so who are familiar with the satires described in the previous
chapter), cannot fail to be struck with the alterations which took
place in his style at different periods of the career we have already
been considering. George Cruikshank&rsquo;s peculiar style and manner,
which enable us to recognise his work at a glance, was the outcome
of a very slow and gradual process of development. In the first
instance he closely copied Gillray, but soon acquired a manner of
his own, blending the two styles after a fashion which is both interesting
and amusing to follow. Soon, however, the style of the
master was discontinued, and gradually the artist began to discover
that the bent of his genius lay in altogether another direction.
Unlike Thomas Rowlandson, the moment Cruikshank became
an illustrator of books, he realized the fact that the style adapted to
graphic satire was unsuitable for the purposes of this branch of art,
and thenceforth he adopted a style differing from anything which
had gone before. The revolution thus accomplished (a singular
proof of the genius of the man) was effected without effort, and is
strikingly manifest in an early book illustration representing the
execution of Madame Tiquet and her accomplice, in 1699. The
design to which we refer, which we believe is rare and little known,
was engraved by H. R. Cook, from a design by the artist for the
frontispiece to a collection of narratives by Cecil, &ldquo;printed for
Hone,&rdquo; in 1819, and stands by virtue of its force and character
apart from most of the book illustrations of the period. From the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>168</span>
moment that the new style was adopted, the artist&rsquo;s services were
brought into requisition for the purposes of book illustration; and
from the time work of this kind began to come in, he relaxed and
afterwards discontinued the practice of caricature. It is as an
etcher and designer of book illustrations we shall henceforth have
to consider him, and in this character one of his famous illustrations
to &ldquo;Greenwich Hospital&rdquo; will be found superior to the whole series
of Rowlandson&rsquo;s careless overdrawn designs to the three &ldquo;Tours&rdquo;
of Syntax put together.</p>

<p>This alteration in the man&rsquo;s style after he took to book illustration
is known only to those familiar with his early caricatures. If
you take, for instance, the etching of <i>St. Swithin&rsquo;s Chapel</i>, of the
&ldquo;Sketch Book,&rdquo; or <i>The Gin Shop</i> in the &ldquo;Scraps and Sketches&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_85" href="#Footnote_85"><span class="sp">85</span></a>
(we are speaking of course of the early <i>coloured</i> impressions), and
show them together with any two of the caricatures we have named
to a person who had never before seen either, we will venture to say
that he would pronounce them without hesitation to be executed by
entirely different hands.</p>

<p>After Lockhart&rsquo;s statement that George Cruikshank was capable
<span class="sn">George&rsquo;s ideas of Female Beauty.</span>
of designing an <i>Annunciation</i>, a <i>Beatification</i>, or an <i>Apotheosis</i>, we
must accept his assertion that he &ldquo;understood the [human] figure
completely&rdquo; with a certain amount of reservation. Perhaps he did;
and if he did, he certainly played some extraordinary tricks with the
&ldquo;figure&rdquo; aforesaid. The truth is, that we forget the artist&rsquo;s weaknesses,
many and glaring as they are, in the lustre of his unexampled <i>genius</i>.
<i>The Times</i>, in an otherwise laudatory article which it published after
his death, remarked that &ldquo;there was not a single beautiful face or
figure probably in the whole range of Cruikshank&rsquo;s work.&rdquo; Now,
although this is not entirely true, there is at least so much of truth
in it that we may admit that the cases in which he has produced a
pretty face or figure are very few and far between, and even those
cases seem rather to have been the result of accident than of design.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>169</span>
There is no getting over the fact that George&rsquo;s ideas of female
beauty were, to say the least of them, peculiar: his women are
fearfully and wonderfully made; they are horse-faced; their eyebrows
are black and strongly marked; their hair is plastered to the
sides of their faces, and meet bobs of hair at the back of their heads;
their waists are as thin as their necks; and they all bear a strong
family likeness to one another. <i>The Times</i> assertion is happily,
however, so broad that it is easy to traverse and contradict it.
George&rsquo;s handsome women are so few, that it is difficult at the
moment to say where any of them may be found. I know at least
of one amazingly handsome one&mdash;the <i>London Barrow Woman</i> in
Hone&rsquo;s &ldquo;Every-Day Book.&rdquo; Some pretty servant girls will be found
in the etching of <i>The Sergeant Introducing his Dutch Wife to his
Friends</i> in &ldquo;St. James&rsquo;s, or the Court of Queen Anne,&rdquo; and I will
undertake to point out at least half a dozen pretty faces in the
course of illustrations to &ldquo;The Miser&rsquo;s Daughter&rdquo;; but after all,
these are only exceptions to the general rule; and it may be safely
conceded that as a delineator of female beauty, George could not
hold a candle to John Leech, to John Tenniel, or even to his own
brother, Isaac Robert.</p>

<p>As for the celebrated Cruikshankian steed, I give him up
<span class="sn">The Cruikshankian Steed.</span>
at once as an utterly irreclaimable and unmanageable brute.
Thackeray, writing in 1840, said, that &ldquo;though our artist does not
draw horses very scientifically, to use the phrase of the <i>atelier</i>; he
feels them very keenly, and his queer animals, after one is used to
them, answer quite as well as better.&rdquo; Even on this subject, however,
the ablest critics have contradicted each other. George
Augustus Sala tells us that the artist &ldquo;could draw the ordinary nag
of real life well enough,&rdquo; and cites by way of example the very
horses of the celebrated <i>Deaf Postilion</i>, in &ldquo;Three Courses and a
Dessert,&rdquo; which Thackeray had previously held up to well-merited
execration. He goes on to tell us that when George &ldquo;essayed to
portray a charger or a hunter, or a lady&rsquo;s hack, or even a pair of
carriage horses, the result was the most grotesque of failures. The
noble animal has, I apprehend, forty-four &lsquo;points,&rsquo; technically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>170</span>
speaking, and from the muzzle to the spavin-place, from the crest to
the withers, from the root of the dock to the fetlock, George was
wrong in them all. His fiery steed bore an equal resemblance to a
Suffolk punch with the head of a griffin and the legs of an antelope,
and that traditionary cockhorse on which the lady was supposed to
ride to Banbury Cross with rings on her fingers and bells on her
toes.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_86" href="#Footnote_86"><span class="sp">86</span></a> His peculiarities notwithstanding, George himself was in
no wise conscious of them, and never hesitated to introduce &ldquo;the
fiery untamed&rdquo; into any scene&mdash;battle or otherwise&mdash;in which the
services of the eccentric animal might be turned to account. We
find him assisting Washington in his triumphal journey to the
capitol; astonishing the French squares in the character of a Mameluke
charger at the Battle of the Pyramids; and leaping into the
lake along with &ldquo;Herne the Hunter,&rdquo; that peculiar creation of the
late Mr. Harrison Ainsworth, on which supernatural occasion he
comes out, as might have been expected, with peculiar force and
vigour.</p>

<p>Thackeray, moreover, says of his trees, that they were decidedly
original, &ldquo;being decidedly of his own make and composition, not
imitated from any master;&rdquo; another and a minor difficulty with the
artist was a boot, which he invariably drew half a foot too long.
George lived in the days of straps, and being strictly conservative in
principle, when he met with a pair of trousers, his idea of the
&ldquo;fitness of things&rdquo; was not satisfied until he pinned them to the
wearer&rsquo;s feet with a pair of these most uncomfortable appendages.</p>

<p>Against these shortcomings, which are a sufficient answer to those
who would give him credit for possessing the faculty of designing
&ldquo;Annunciations, Beatifications, Apotheoses,&rdquo; and the like, we must
set his excellencies, the power and brilliancy of his imaginative
faculties, his extraordinary talents of conception and realization, the
delicacy of his manipulation and execution: in a word, the strong
original &ldquo;genius&rdquo; with which Lockhart credited him from the
moment he had seen his &ldquo;Points of Humour.&rdquo; Examples of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>171</span>
&ldquo;genius&rdquo; might be cited by the thousand. Look only at the
famous &ldquo;Sketch Book;&rdquo; its recent republication has placed it within
the reach of every one of our readers. Look at the <i>Sprig of
Shelalegh</i>, the rollicking, whiskey drinking, fighting, devil-may-care
<i>expression</i> he has thrown into that <i>piece of wood</i>; turn to
the sheet wherein he has recorded his <i>Recollections of the Court
of Common Pleas</i>, and study the group of lawyers&rsquo; and witnesses&rsquo;
faces therein contained. There is &ldquo;genius&rdquo; for you, if you will.
If you are overworked, turn to them; they will do you good, for
they will not only make you merry, but force upon you the conviction
that the conception which created them was essentially original.
It is this delightful originality of George Cruikshank which constitutes
his <i>genius</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No plan!&rdquo; &ldquo;no ambition!&rdquo; &ldquo;not much industry!&rdquo; so at least
said Lockhart. We may doubt whether even at the time it was
spoken this charge had any foundation of truth to rest upon; an
answer to it at least will be found in the fact that, before the
mysterious spell had fallen upon him we shall presently have to
describe, this sterling and indefatigable genius had already produced
thousands upon thousands of miraculous little drawings. From the
mass of these wonderful creations we propose now to select a few
examples, choosing them in the first instance from a graver type
than some we shall presently have to consider.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Greenwich Hospital&rdquo; gives us one of the very best drawings
which Cruikshank ever designed. The scene of the <i>Point of Honour</i>
is laid on board the <i>Triumph</i>, at Spithead, at the time of the famous
mutiny. A detachment of marines with shouldered arms are drawn
up on the quarter deck, their drummer is beating to quarters, while
all hands are assembled to witness a degrading and demoralizing
spectacle,&mdash;a sailor, with his shoulders bare and his hands tied to
the triangles, about to receive punishment for disobedience to orders.
Conspicuous amongst the figures are two little middies, habited in
the strange naval uniform of sixty years ago. The illustration to
<i>The Braintrees</i>, at page 90 of the &ldquo;Three Courses and a Dessert&rdquo;
is a marvellous specimen, not only of the graphic power of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>172</span>
artist, but a triumph of the wood-engraver&rsquo;s craft. In <i>The Gin Shop</i>
(&ldquo;Sketches by Boz&rdquo;), the artist selected a subject which invariably
enlisted his sympathy and called into action the full power of his
graphic satire. Mark the flaming gas, the huge spirit vats, the
gaudily painted pillars and mouldings; above all, the strange people:
the young man with his hat on one side who chaffs the young ladies
behind the bar, the gin-drinking female by his side, the gin-loving
cripple, the small boy who brings the family bottle to be filled with gin,
whose head barely reaches the counter, the gin-drinking charwoman
to the left, and the quarrelsome gin-drinking Irish customers at the
back. Everything in this picture reeks of <i>gin</i>; the only persons not
imbibing it are the proprietor and his dowdy barmaids, whom I have
no manner of doubt the artist intended to look captivating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a fine touching picture of melancholy desolation,&rdquo; remarks
Thackeray, &ldquo;is that of &lsquo;Sikes and the dog.&rsquo; The poor cur is
not too well drawn, the landscape is stiff and formal; but in this
case the faults, if faults they be, of execution rather add to than
diminish the effect of the picture: it has a strange, wild, dreary,
broken-hearted look; we fancy we see the landscape as it must have
appeared to Sikes, when ghastly and with bloodshot eyes he looked
at it.&rdquo; The etching of <i>Jonathan Wild Discovering Darrell in the
Loft</i> [&ldquo;Jack Sheppard&rdquo;] reminds one, in its treatment, of Rembrandt,
for the work of Cruikshank, be it observed, distinctly shows in its
results that he studied both Hogarth and Rembrandt. The effect
the artist has produced is wonderful; the ray of light thrown through
the gloom upon the figure of Darrell as he stands against the wall,
sword in hand, is capitally managed, &ldquo;while the intricacies of the
tile-work, and the mysterious twinkling of light among the beams
are excellently felt and rendered.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_87" href="#Footnote_87"><span class="sp">87</span></a> <i>Simon Renard and Winwike
on the Roof of the White Tower</i> [&ldquo;Tower of London&rdquo;] is another
admirable drawing. The scene is laid on the platform of one
of the antique guns which frown from the embrasures of the river
face of the fortress. The head of Renard is not well drawn. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>173</span>
character of the ambassador gives one the idea of a Spanish Iago,
a clever, calculating knave, whom we should credit with the possession
of a broad and lofty forehead, indicative of deep and concentrated
thought; in the etching, however, before us, he has
none at all, a deficiency compensated by puffy cheeks and a preposterous
beak. These imperfections, which in another artist
would mar the drawing, serve only to throw its excellencies into
prominent notice. The lights and shadows are most effectively
rendered, and the setting sun throws a broad light upon the features
of the warder, who has laid aside his arquebus while conversing with
the wily Spaniard. Of the many who have noticed the well-known
etching of <i>Born a Genius and Born a Dwarf</i> [&ldquo;Comic Almanack,
1847&rdquo;], not one (so far at least as we know) has ever mentioned its
origin. The subject was prompted by one of the last entries in the
diary of poor Benjamin Robert Haydon, who died by his own hand
on the 22nd of June, 1846, his corpse being found at the foot of
his colossal picture of <i>Alfred the Great and the First British Jury</i>.
The entry runs as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Tom Thumb had 12,000 people last
week, B. R. Haydon 133-1/2 (the 1/2 a little girl). Exquisite taste of the
English people!&rdquo; In the etching which shows us <i>Randulph and
Hilda Dancing in the Rotunda at Ranelagh</i> [&ldquo;Miser&rsquo;s Daughter&rdquo;],
he brings us face to face with our great-grandfathers and great-grandmothers;
wherever he got his authority from, the huge circular
hall with galleries and arches running round it, illuminated by a
thousand lamps, and the curious orchestra with the old-fashioned
sounding-board above, are no freak of the artist&rsquo;s imagination. The
etching possesses a wondrous charm of reality. We find ourselves
assisting, as it were, at one of the masquerades described in &ldquo;Sir
Charles Grandison&rdquo;; many of the company are in fancy dresses,
and we find it difficult to realize, in these broad-cloth days, that the
gentlemen in the velvet coats, with gold-bound embroidered waistcoats,
silk stockings, silver gilt rapiers, and laced hats, dancing
minuets with Chinamen, harlequins, scaramouches, templars, and
other fancifully-dressed persons, are simply wearing the every-day
costume of men of fashion of the day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>174</span></p>

<p>Perhaps more than any other comic artist of past or present time,
<span class="sn">Mannerism.</span>
George is distinguished by his mannerisms. His horses, his women,
the costumes of his male and female characters, the cut of their
garments and of their boots, the arrangement of their hair, will
proclaim his individuality anywhere; and yet, if you look at any
of the designs which he executed in his best and brightest days,
before he took up with the mania which contributed, as we shall
presently see, so largely to the ruin of his artistic genius, fame, and
fortunes, we cannot fail to be impressed with the quaintness of
his imagination. In this quaintness and originality lie the charm
and freshness which is the peculiar characteristic of his designs.
Unlike those of other artists, you may turn over volume after volume
of his sketches, and be conscious of no sense of weariness. Much
of this no doubt is due to their constant variety. Unlike the
generality of modern illustrators, he is not limited to the costumes
and incidents of the every-day commonplace life of the nineteenth
century; he does not confine himself to humour; his fancy takes
a wider range, and revels in subjects of wonder, diablery, and
romance. Gnomes and fairies, devils and goblins, knights, giants,
jesters, and morris dancers are continually passing before us;
there is an endless succession of novelties, treated with a quaintness
of fancy which distinguishes it above all others; there is a
ceaseless variety in his <i>dramatis personæ</i>, while the characters are
as various as the subjects. In these characteristics seem to lie the
secret of the pleasure which his illustrations, whether they be drawn
on wood or etched on the copper, never fail to inspire.</p>

<p>The sale and purchase of Peter Schlemihl&rsquo;s <i>Shadow</i> has been
noticed by Thackeray. We see the Old Gentleman neatly packing
up his purchase after the manner of an &ldquo;old clo&rsquo;&rdquo; dealer; he has
just &ldquo;lifted the <i>shadow of one leg</i>; he is going to fold it back neatly,
as one does the tails of a coat, and will stow it, without any creases
or crumples, along with the other black garments that lie in that
immense pocket of his.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_88" href="#Footnote_88"><span class="sp">88</span></a> Another illustration in the same book
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>175</span>
shows us Peter, after he has repented of his bargain (as vendors
invariably do who indulge in mercantile transactions of this character)
in ardent pursuit of his shadow, which the tantilizing purchaser
has let out for the occasion. Can anything more ludicrous be
imagined than this scampering piece of intangibility? The etching
of <i>Sailors Carousing</i> [&ldquo;Greenwich Hospital&rdquo;], executed in 1826,
before the artist had altogether discontinued the style and manner
of Gillray, would have delighted the heart of that accomplished
caricaturist. An old one-eyed salt presides over a vast bowl of
punch, the contents of which he is engaged in distributing to the
company. One enthusiastic tar foots it with such vigour that he
cannons against a potman, upsetting him and the measure of scalding
liquor he carries over another angry, blaspheming sailor man;
another sea worthy, snoring drunk, has converted his quart pot into
an impromptu pillow, his own recumbent form serving the purposes
of a footstool to a companion. The females are a combination of
the styles of Gillray and Cruikshank, and, with one exception, are
old, ugly, and preposterously fat. A comical illustration in the
same book is called, <i>Paying off a Jew Pedlar</i>. The unhappy
man (who had cheated the sailors), innocent of danger, is seated
on a grating with his combs, spy-glasses, necklaces, ribbons, and
all the rest of his &ldquo;Brummagem&rdquo; trumpery, spread out before
him. The men, who have slily hitched a rope to the grating, suddenly
give it a hoist, and away slides Moses, with all his wares and
trumpery, into the hold together! How poor Seymour would
have revelled in that admirable tailpiece in &ldquo;Three Courses and
a Dessert,&rdquo; where an unhappy wight, pursued by a bull, manages to
scramble atop of a gate-post (the only part free from spikes), to
find his escape cut off on one side by a couple of bull-dogs, and
on the other by a <i>chevaux-de-frise</i> terminating in a horse pond!
We meet with a solemn piece of fun in <i>Simpkin Dancing to the
Musicians</i>, one of the illustrations to the celebrated &ldquo;New Bath
Guide&rdquo; of Christopher Anstey&mdash;</p>

<p><i>The Last Cab Driver</i> [&ldquo;Sketches by Boz&rdquo;] deserves a passing
notice, because it has preserved from oblivion a class of vehicles
which has long since disappeared from the London streets. It
looked for all the world like the section of a coffin set on end, the
seat (which was intended to accommodate only one person besides
the driver) occupying the centre. The cabman being a very <i>mauvais
sujet</i>, we find the surroundings (after the artist&rsquo;s practice) in
strict keeping with his character. The building past which he
drives is marked &ldquo;Old Bailey&rdquo;; whilst a snuff manufacturer in the
street at the back advertises himself as the vendor of &ldquo;Real Irish
Blackguard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dry, quaint humour of the author of &ldquo;Waverley&rdquo; exactly
<span class="sn">Waverley Novels.</span>
suited the quaint imaginings of our artist. Both Scott and Cruikshank
delighted in the supernatural and the marvellous, and this is
why some of the most characteristic of the artist&rsquo;s designs are to be
found in his illustrations to the &ldquo;Waverley Novels.&rdquo; In one of
these he shows us the illustrious Dominie at the moment, when
reaching over to gather a water-lily, he falls souse into the Slough
of Lochend, in which he forthwith became bogged up to the middle,
his plight drawing from him of course his favourite ejaculation of
amazement. By the assistance of some women the luckless
Dominie was extracted from his position, justifying the remark of
one of his assistants, that &ldquo;the laird might as weel trust the care of
his bairn to a potato-bogle.&rdquo; Which was the most helpless of the
two men&mdash;the Laird of Dumbiedikes, or the illustrious Dominie&mdash;it
would be difficult to say; both these most original characters took
a powerful hold on the artist&rsquo;s imagination, and as a natural consequence
the ideas of Scott were completely realized. A very comical
design is that in which he shows us the worthy but witless laird
with his laced cocked hat and empty tobacco pipe,<a name="FnAnchor_89" href="#Footnote_89"><span class="sp">89</span></a> and his hand
extended &ldquo;like the claw of a heraldic griffin,&rdquo; when he managed to
utter something beyond his usual morning greeting, and frightened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>177</span>
Jeannie into the belief that he had so far &ldquo;screwed his courage to
the sticking place&rdquo; as to venture on a matrimonial proposal, to
which unwonted effort of imagination his intelligence, however,
proved altogether unequal.</p>

<p>In the &ldquo;Comic Almanack&rdquo; will be found many examples of
<span class="sn">Alliterative Designs.</span>
George&rsquo;s tendency to graphic alliteration. <i>The Fall of the Leaf</i>
affords a capital specimen of the kind of design to which we allude.
The leaf of the dinner-table has been so insecurely fastened that it
falls, burying with it the mistress of the house, the fish, the champagne,
a sherry decanter, a vase of flowers,&mdash;everything, in fact, to
which it formed a treacherous and unreliable support; Gibbon&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Decline and Fall&rdquo; lies in a corner of the room, and the walls are
hung with appropriate subjects, such as the Fall of Foyers, the
Falls of Niagara, Falls of the Clyde, and so on. An illustration of
a similar kind will be found in <i>Taurus&mdash;a Literary Bull</i>. The
animal has rushed into a printing office and scattered the compositors
right and left; some seek shelter beneath their frames, one
clambers wildly up the shelves of a paper case, while others scuttle
over the frames, and one man, too wholly dismayed and bewildered
to run, brandishes a stool in helpless imbecility. The bull is perhaps
the most astonished of the <i>dramatis personæ</i>, and evidently
wonders into what manner of place fate has brought him. The
walls are pasted with appropriate advertisements: &ldquo;Some Account
of the Pope&rsquo;s Bull,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Cock and Bull Story,&rdquo; &ldquo;Theatre Royal, Haymarket&mdash;John
Bull&rdquo; &ldquo;To be Sold by Auction, the Bull Inn,&rdquo; &ldquo;Abstract
of the Act against Bull-baiting,&rdquo; and so on. In <i>Libra Striking
the Balance</i> (same year), a dishonest tradesman has been detected in
using false weights and measures. The beadle holds up a pair of
scales, one of which weighs very much heavier than the other. The
wretched culprit, conscious, all too late, that honesty would have
proved &ldquo;the best policy&rdquo; for himself, leans against his shelves the
picture of sullen and detected guilt. The window of the shop bears
on it the painted <i>legend</i> of &ldquo;The cheapest shop in London.&rdquo; Leaning
against the counter we find a programme of the &ldquo;City Theatre,&rdquo;
announcing the performance of &ldquo;Measure for Measure&rdquo;: to conclude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>178</span>
with &ldquo;Honest Thieves&rdquo;; an officer outside (surrounded by a deeply
interested crowd) is engaged in breaking up a second pair of dishonest
scales. Chronology, difference in politics, character, tastes,
and disposition, are most amusingly set at defiance in the etching
entitled <i>The Revolution at Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s</i> [1847]: Mary Queen
of Scots &ldquo;treads a measure&rdquo; with William Penn the Quaker; Fox
and Pitt make long noses at each other from opposite sides of the
room; O&rsquo;Connell shakes hands with Freschi, to whom our old
friend the elderly country gentleman offers a friendly pinch of snuff;
William Shakespeare flirts with an almond-eyed Chinese woman;
Henry the Eighth smokes a long churchwarden with Judge Jefferys;
Lord Byron (with greater propriety) exchanges friendly greetings
with Jean Jacques Rousseau; whilst the great Napoleon unbends,
as chroniclers assert that he was wont to do, and waltzes round the
room with Madame Tussaud, and Britannia (to the uproarious delight
of Sir William Wallace) rasps her trident across her shield, by
way of accompaniment to the fiddle of the Saturnine Paganini.</p>

<p>The fun of these side splitting designs is only equalled by their
variety. The &ldquo;Almanack&rdquo; of 1838 introduces us to the inevitable
row which forms the wind-up of a Hibernian <i>festa</i>; chairs, sticks,
shovels,&mdash;anything that comes to hand is used without fear or
favour; men, women, children struggle together in inextricable
confusion amidst the <i>débris</i> of wrecked furniture, broken glass,
and battered pewter; high above the din drone the nasal tones
of the piper; while amidst the infernal clatter &ldquo;the praist&rdquo; vainly
endeavours to re-establish order and make himself heard. <i>Theatrical
Fun Dinner</i> (1841) represents the close of the banquet. Hamlet
is already too far gone to know what he is doing; Othello belabours
Iago with a bottle; Shylock and Antonio fraternize; whilst a reconciliation
is established between Macbeth and Macduff, who
chink glasses by way of cementing their friendship; Sir John
Falstaff lights his pipe at Bardolph&rsquo;s nose; whilst Romeo hands
up a glass of something short and strong to his Juliet in the
balcony. 1842 gives us the celebrated etching of &ldquo;<i>Gone!</i>&rdquo; an
auctioneer &ldquo;knocking down&rdquo; a bust of Socrates; at the word
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>179</span>
&ldquo;<i>gone</i>&rdquo; the flooring gives way, and auctioneer, buyers, and Socrates,
with all their surroundings, descend with a simultaneous crash
into the cellars below. Drowning men catch at straws, and the
spectacled visage of the auctioneer, as he clings wildly to his rostrum,
is a perfect study of terrified imbecility.</p>

<p>In looking at these quaint designs, the mind of any one possessed
of any imagination at all cannot fail to be impressed with a sense
of the original train of thought which must have characterized the
man who could conceive and realize them. How appropriately
and admirably, even in trivial matters, the details of the design are
worked out! If the reader will refer to the etching in &ldquo;St. James&rsquo;,&rdquo;
where the sergeant places the boot of his master, the Duke of
Marlborough, on a map of Flanders, he will at once see what we
mean. The action is accidental; and yet where could the boot
have been placed with greater propriety? for surely if any country
was under the heel of the great English captain, it was Flanders.
Nothing to equal these designs are ever seen in these days, perhaps
nothing like them will ever be seen again. There are many
excellent comic designs produced by our artists of to-day; but
with the exception, perhaps, of Mr. Caldicott and Colonel Seccombe,
they lack <i>character</i>. You pass them by, and straightway forget them.
Not so with these admirable little designs; you turn to them again
and again, and each time with a refreshing sense of pleasure.
Herein seems to lie the power of true genius&mdash;that its productions
give not only a sense of freshness and delight, but that the sensation
so conveyed will not die. There are people, I believe, on whom
they produce no such impression; such people, as regards comic
art, are for all practical purposes &ldquo;dry bones,&rdquo; and to dry bones
such as these the pencil of &ldquo;honest George&rdquo; will appeal in vain.</p>

<p>Some writers on the subject of Cruikshank and his work would
have us believe that he developed his highest powers of imagination
and fancy, and achieved his highest reputation, when depicting
subjects of a fairy or supernatural order. Whether these scribes be
right or whether they be wrong, there is no doubt that he discovered
for himself an enchanted land of mountain and streamlet, of meadow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>180</span>
and waterfall, of gnomes and fairies, of demons, witches, and of
giants. The process by which he attained his excellence as an
illustrator of fairy lore and legend has been related by himself in
his own simple, unpolished words in the (so-called) &ldquo;Fairy Library.&rdquo;
Unquestionably the opportunity which these subjects afforded of
exercising untrammelled his marvellous gifts of imagination and
fancy, and of realizing objects which owe their being to the creative
faculties of his mind, were eagerly embraced by the artist; but,
although the results were singularly weird and often very beautiful,
I find myself obliged to differ from those who would have us believe
that in realizing subjects of this kind he attained his highest excellence.
The charm of George Cruikshank&rsquo;s talent lies in the fact
that notwithstanding his defects in drawing, <i>everything</i> he took in
hand is impressed with the stamp of a strong and original genius;
it is like nothing we have seen before; every one of his designs is
marked with distinctive features of beauty, quaintness, or originality
peculiar to himself.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;German Popular Stories&rdquo; probably contain the most
striking specimens of Cruikshank&rsquo;s power as a designer of <i>fairy</i>
subjects. In reference to these illustrations, our great critic, Mr.
Ruskin, says: &ldquo;They are of quite sterling and admirable art, in a
class precisely parallel in elevation to the character of the tales
which they illustrate; and the original etchings, as I have before
said in the Appendix to my &lsquo;Elements of Drawing,&rsquo; were unrivalled
in masterfulness of touch since Rembrandt, in some qualities of
delineation unrivalled even by him.&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>The Two Elves</i>,&rdquo; says
Hamerton, &ldquo;especially the nearer one, who is putting on his
breeches, are drawn with a point at once so precise and vivacious,
so full of keen fun and inimitably happy invention, that I have not
found their equal in comic etching anywhere ... the picturesque
details of the room are etched with the same felicitous intelligence;
but the marvel of the work is in the expression of the strange little
faces, and the energy of the comical wee limbs.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_90" href="#Footnote_90"><span class="sp">90</span></a> In <i>The Witches&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>181</span>
Frolic</i> [&ldquo;Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft&rdquo;], we find a happy
blending of the terrible and the grotesque. Look at the old hags
floating out to sea in their tubs; and the strange, uncanny thing
with dreadful eyes bobbing up and down midway between the
foremost old woman and the distant vessel. The <i>thing</i> may be a
ship, it may be a fish, or it may be a fiend,&mdash;in the dim half light we
cannot tell what,&mdash;but it is horribly suggestive of nightmare, and
makes one laugh as well as shudder. Some ghostly goblins, the
creations of George&rsquo;s weird fancy, will be found in &ldquo;The Omnibus&rdquo;;
we see them following a ghostly ship manned by ghostly mariners,
and we find in the same book ghostly Dutchmen playing a game of
diabolical leap-frog with Australian kangaroos. In one illustration
he introduces us to a cheerful assembly of ancestral ghosts: there
is the ghostly saucer-eyed head of the family, with a ghostly hound
peeping beneath his chair, a ghostly grandmother, half a dozen
ghostly spinster aunts, a ghostly butler, a ghostly cook, a ghostly small
boy, two ghostly candles; and lastly, a ghostly cat. Small wonder
that under the influence of such ghostly surroundings the hair of
the affrighted ghost-seer stands erect in the extremity of his terror.</p>

<p>This same book contains, too, the celebrated etching of <i>Jack
o&rsquo;Lantern</i>, probably the best illustration of the supernatural which
we owe to the pencil and weird imagination of the artist. &ldquo;Talk of
Fuseli and his wind-bag, there is real vivid imagination enough in
this to make a whole academy of Fuselis. It is just an Egyptian
darkness, with breaking through it, above a bog-hole, some black
bulrushes, and above them a bending, leathery goblin exulting over
some drowned traveller, the meteor lamp he carries casting a downward
flicker on the dark water. Such darkness, such wicked
speed, such bad, Puck-like malice, such devilry, Hoffman and Poe
together could not have better devised. Many a May exhibition
has not half the genius in all its pictures that focuses in that gem
of jet.&rdquo; The description is admirable; but Walter Thornbury has
altogether misconceived the artist&rsquo;s idea. <i>Jack o&rsquo;Lantern</i> is simply
misguiding a belated traveller into a bog, and the elfin grin which
pervades his countenance testifies to the delight he takes in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>182</span>
mischievous employment.  The words of the song in Dryden&rsquo;s
<i>King Arthur</i> convey the best possible description of this wondrous
conception:&mdash;</p>

<p>By way of contrast to all these, I would turn to the celebrated and
much-too-often-described <i>Triumph of Cupid</i>, of the &ldquo;Table Book&rdquo;;

counted by the ream, I have no intention whatever of contributing
a further addition.</p>

<p>A notice, however, of George Cruikshank&rsquo;s supernatural work
would be incomplete without some reference to his <i>devils</i>. From
time immemorial our idea of His Satanic Majesty has been associated
with the distinguishing appendages of horns, hoofs, and a cow&rsquo;s
tail. &ldquo;A conceit there is,&rdquo; says old Sir Thomas Browne, &ldquo;that the
devil commonly appeareth with a cloven hoof, wherein, although it
seems excessively ridiculous, there may be somewhat of truth, and
the ground thereof at first might be his frequent appearing in the
shape of a goat, which answers the description.&rdquo; George Cruikshank
too well apprehended the cunning nature of His Satanic
Majesty to suppose him idiotic enough to introduce his hoofs, his
horns, or his tail into the company of all sorts and conditions of
men. It will be remembered that Fitz Dottrel takes leave to doubt
the identity of the devil who waits upon him in the character of a
body servant. &ldquo;You cannot,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;cozen <i>me</i>. Your shoe&rsquo;s not
cloven, sir; you are whole hoofed.&rdquo; But &ldquo;Pug&rdquo; simply and unaffectedly
assures him, &ldquo;Sir, that&rsquo;s a popular error,&mdash;deceives many.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_91" href="#Footnote_91"><span class="sp">91</span></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>183</span>
Like &ldquo;Pug,&rdquo; George Cruikshank&rsquo;s devils accommodate themselves,
their appearance, and their costume to the prejudices of the
persons they design to serve. With saints and perverse sinners it
is obvious that any attempt at disguise would be futile; but with so
respectable a person as a Dutch burgher, or so suspicious an individual
as an English lawyer, the case is altogether different. We have
specimens of the respectable devil in the &ldquo;long-legged bondholder&rdquo;
who appears to his unfortunate Dutch debtor; the portly, well-dressed
little man in the &ldquo;Gentleman in black&rdquo;; and the seedy looking
old clothes dealer of &ldquo;Peter Schlemihl.&rdquo; Quite a different devil
to any of these is the devil that interviews St. Nicholas, the devil
whom St. Medard circumvented, or the simple-minded and unfortunate
devil that fell into the clutches of St. Dunstan. This last is
probably the most comical <i>diabolique</i> that Cruikshank ever designed.
In an evil hour this miserable fiend had irritated the saint by mimicking
his musical powers; and growing bolder with impunity, even
ventured to challenge his skill as a mechanic, by doubting his ability
to fit a shoe to his own diabolical hoof. The saint promptly whipped
up the leg, and it was not until this simple devil found himself in
the clutches of the saint, that he fully comprehended the prodigious
powers of the holy personage he had ventured to chaff. In spite
of his howls and frantic efforts to escape, the iron shoe is remorselessly
fitted, and nail after nail driven into the quick. Imagine
the sufferings of that poor devil; observe his comically distorted
countenance as he bellows with agony and impotent rage; how his
tail curls round his leg in the extremity of his anguish! The worst
perhaps has to follow, for in spite of the agony of his crippled hoof,
a deed will have to be &ldquo;signed, sealed, and delivered,&rdquo; by which his
claim to a legion of sinful souls has to be for ever released and
extinguished. It is worthy of remark that George Cruikshank&rsquo;s
devils&mdash;simple-minded, weak creatures, more mischievous than really
wicked, in all their contests with the saints (Saint Anthony excepted)
invariably come off second best.</p>

<p>In estimating his merits, the genius of George Cruikshank may
not inaptly be compared to a diamond. One facet often emits more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>184</span>
brilliant coruscations than any other; and if we may be permitted
to compare his powers of realizing the grave, the comical, the supernatural,
and the terrible to the facets of a diamond, we think the one
which would be found to emit the most brilliant flashes of light
would be the last. Thackeray, one of the most friendly and most
competent of his critics, would seem to have considered that much
of his power was shown in depicting subjects of this kind. &ldquo;What
a fine eye,&rdquo; he tells us, in his famous article which has supplied the
backbone&mdash;the muscles&mdash;the very integuments of so many others,&mdash;&ldquo;what
a fine eye the artist has, what a skilful hand, and what a
sympathy for the wild and dreadful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>From an early period of his career as an etcher and designer,
George had waged a deadly war with gin,&mdash;that potent, insidious, and
evil spirit of London; the most priceless services he rendered to the
cause of temperance being unquestionably given long before he had
any notion of joining the ranks of the total abstainers. Like the
<i>Triumph of Cupid</i>, the well-known <i>Gin Juggernaut</i> of the &ldquo;Sketch
Book&rdquo; requires nothing more than a passing allusion. An example
less known but quite as admirable will be found in the &ldquo;Scraps and
Sketches.&rdquo; It is called <i>The Gin Shop</i>,<a name="FnAnchor_92" href="#Footnote_92"><span class="sp">92</span></a> and shows us the interior
of a London gin palace. In place of the usual barrels, around the
walls are ranged coffins, labelled respectively: &ldquo;Deady&rsquo;s Cordial;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Blue Ruin;&rdquo; &ldquo;Gin and Bitters;&rdquo; the largest (a huge one) being
marked &ldquo;Old Tom.&rdquo; Death, habited as a watchman, has baited a
huge gin trap, wherein stand five persons (two of them children, besides
a baby in arms), <i>all</i> imbibing the deadly liquid. The wretched
woman with the infant has actually placed her foot on the spring,
and so great is the artist&rsquo;s power of realization, that we momentarily
expect to see the horrible thing close with a snap! A skeleton,
whose fleshless skull is masked with a pleasant female countenance,
officiates as barmaid, and behind her yawns a pit, on the further side
of which a circle of evil spirits curvet around a huge still. Just
such a weird scene as would strike a sympathetic chord in the artist&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>185</span>
fancy was found for him in Scott&rsquo;s novel of &ldquo;Red Gauntlet.&rdquo; The
episode selected for illustration is the frightful adventure of Hutcheon
and Dougal MacCallum. &ldquo;When midnight came, and the house
was quiet as the grave, the silver whistle sounded as sharp and shrill
as if Sir Robert was blowing it, and up got the two old serving-men
and tottered into the room where the dead man lay. Hutcheon
saw enough at the first glance; for there were torches in the room,
which showed him the foul fiend in his ain shape, sitting on the
laird&rsquo;s coffin! Ower he couped, as if he had been dead. He could
not tell how long he lay in a trance at the door; but when he
gathered himself, he cried on his neighbour, and getting nae answer,
raised the house, when Dougal was found lying dead within twa
steps of the bed where his master&rsquo;s coffin was placed. As for the
whistle, it was lost ance and aye, but mony a time it was heard at
the top of the house on the bartizan and among the auld chimneys
and turrets, where the howlets have their nests.&rdquo; The coffin of the
dead laird lies in state on a table covered with black cloth, richly
ornamented with his armorial bearings; at the foot of the bier
stands his black plumed helmet; while atop of the coffin crouches
the grinning ape with the laird&rsquo;s whistle in his paw; on the ground,
as they have been tossed about by the mischievous beast, lie his
rapier, gauntlet, and other military trappings. The furniture, the
fittings, the sombre hangings, the gloomy ancestral portraits, all
are in keeping with the weird scene and its surroundings. <i>The
Death of Sikes</i>, and <i>Fagin in the Condemned Cell</i> (especially the
latter) have been described any number of times, and the circumstances,
moreover, under which the latter design was conceived, told
invariably wrong. In the <i>Murder of Sir Rowland Trenchard</i> [&ldquo;Jack
Sheppard&rdquo;], we have a Rembrandtish etching, quite equalling in
power and intensity that of <i>Fagin in the Condemned Cell</i>. The
gloomy depths of the well hole are illumined only by the pine
torch of the frightened Jew, as Wild hammers with his bludgeon on
the fingers of the doomed wretch who, maimed and faint from loss of
blood, clings with desperate tenacity to the bannister, from which his
relaxing grip will presently plunge him into the black abyss below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>186</span></p>

<p>The &ldquo;Tower of London&rdquo; introduces us to two scenes of a dismal
and terrible character in the etching entitled <i>Xit Wedded to the
Scavenger&rsquo;s Daughter</i>, the artist carries us to a gloomy torture
chamber, dimly lighted by a solitary lantern. On the framework of
the rack sits the dwarf Xit, his limbs compressed in the grip of the
frightful instrument called the &ldquo;Scavenger&rsquo;s daughter,&rdquo; while Simon
Renard, scarcely able to repress a smile, interrogates the comical
little figure at his leisure. Behind him stands Sorrocold, the surgeon;
and in the farther corner Mauger (the headsman), Nightgall,
and an assistant torturer, recline against the wall. The feeble rays
of the lantern throw an obscure light upon the gloomy walls
decorated with the stock in trade of the torturers, thumb-screws,
gauntlets, collars, pinchers, saws, chains, and other horrible
and suggestive implements. Affixed to the ceiling is a steel
pulley, the rope which traverses it terminating with an iron
hook and two leathern shoulder straps. Facing the gloomy door
stands a brazier filled with blazing coals, in which a huge pair of
pinchers are suggestively heating. Reared against the side of a deep
dark recess is a ponderous wheel&mdash;broad as that of a wagon, and
twice the circumference; and next it the iron bar with which the
bones of those condemned to die by this most horrible torture were
broken while alive. The etching of <i>Mauger Sharpening his Axe</i>
is nearly as celebrated as that of <i>Fagin in the Condemned Cell</i>. &ldquo;A
wonderful weird dusk, with no light but that which glimmers on the
bald scalp of the hideous headsman, who, feeling the edge of his axe
with his thumb, grins with a devilish foretaste of his pleasure on the
morrow. I need scarcely say that all the poetry, dramatic force,
mystery, and terror of the design is attributable to Cruikshank, and
not to Ainsworth.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_93" href="#Footnote_93"><span class="sp">93</span></a> Scenes still more realistically terrible even than
these, such as the <i>Massacre at Tullabogue</i>, <i>The Rebel Camp on Vinegar
Hill</i>, and the <i>Executions at Wexford Bridge</i>, will be found in
Maxwell&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of the Irish Rebellion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Lockhart, we may remember, advised the artist in the early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>187</span>
part of his career to &ldquo;think of Hogarth,&rdquo; and throughout the whole
of George Cruikshank&rsquo;s designs of the graver caste the influence of
the study of Rembrandt and of Hogarth will be apparent to those
acquainted with the characteristics of these great artists. In the
case of Rembrandt it is manifest in the deep shadows, penetrated by
broad but skilfully treated rays of light, throwing the salient parts of
the design into prominent but pleasing relief; in the case of
Hogarth it is shown in minute attention to details of a character
singularly appropriate to the designs. Delineators of subjects of
greater pretension are frequently content to throw all their sympathies,
their energies, into the elaboration of their leading figure or
figures: the attitude, the face, the features, the hands, the costume,
leave nothing to be desired, while the rest of the composition is
slurred or neglected. This is not the case with Cruikshank, every
part of his work bears witness to his careful attention to detail; no
part of it is elaborated at the expense of the rest; from the tenants
of the room down to the smallest and most insignificant ornament
on the chimney-piece, everything appears as distinct as it would
appear in actual every-day life.</p>

<p>But this study of Rembrandt and of Hogarth, this minute attention
to detail, this careful and conscientious elaboration, would have
done little for George Cruikshank if he had not possessed in an
eminent degree that faculty of creation, otherwise of originality, which
men call <i>genius</i>. Various descriptions of this gift have been
attempted by eminent men, but the most felicitous seems to us to be
that given by Robert William Elliston: &ldquo;A true actor,&rdquo; says this
distinguished comedian, &ldquo;must possess the power of <i>creation</i>, which
is <i>genius</i>, as well as the faculty of imitation, which is only <i>talent</i>.&rdquo;
Substitute the word &ldquo;artist&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;actor,&rdquo; and the remark
will apply with equal felicity to the subject of our present chapter.
It was this same gift of genius which, whilst it enabled the artist to
lend a sentient expression to such unpromising subjects as a barrel,
a wig-block, a jug of beer, a pair of bellows, or an oyster, imparted
to his drawings a piquancy which has elevated these apparently insignificant
designs into perfectly sterling works of art. The reader
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>188</span>
who is fortunate enough to number amongst his books the first half-dozen
volumes of &ldquo;Bentley&rsquo;s Miscellany&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ainsworth&rsquo;s Magazine,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Omnibus,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Table Book,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Comic Almanack,&rdquo;
possesses a series of designs, drawn and etched by the hand of
the master himself, the value of which is yearly increasing, not only
because they are becoming scarcer and scarcer every day, but
because nothing like them&mdash;under the conditions in which book
illustration is now produced&mdash;will ever be seen again.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<h5><i>GEORGE CRUIKSHANK</i> (<i>Continued</i>).</h5>

<h5><i>THE SLEEP OF THIRTY YEARS.</i></h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> artistic career of George Cruikshank presents probably one of
the most singular problems to be met with in the history of satirical
art. It may be divided into three portions, two of which we have
already considered: the first represents that section wherein we have
seen him described by Lockhart as &ldquo;one of the most careless
creatures alive,&rdquo; having &ldquo;no plan, almost no ambition,&rdquo; doing &ldquo;just
what was suggested or thrown in his way,&rdquo; &ldquo;quite contented to dine
off the proceeds of a &lsquo;George the Fourth&rsquo; to day, and those of a
&rsquo;Hone&rsquo; or a &lsquo;Cobbett&rsquo; to morrow!&rdquo; the second may be said to be
embraced between the years 1822 and 1848, during which period
we find this man without plan, ambition, or industry (to complete the
charge of Lockhart), busily engaged in building up the reputation
which the critic had so confidently and so truly predicted of him;
the third and last section, the strangest surely of all, shows us this
man of genius&mdash;in the full enjoyment of an assured and well-merited
reputation, in the midst of his artistic vigour, at the height of a
success altogether unexampled&mdash;deliberately throwing away his
opportunities, and consigning himself to a slumber of thirty years,
which might almost justify us in terming him the &ldquo;Rip Van Winkle&rdquo;
of British art. The causes of this strange decadence, this singular
mental inactivity, which seem to us to have been hitherto very little
or at best very imperfectly understood, we now propose to consider.</p>

<p>Professor Bates, one of the ablest of the essayists who have written
<span class="sn">Professor Bates&rsquo; Theory.</span>
on George Cruikshank since the time when Thackeray penned his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>190</span>
famous article, would have us believe that the causes which led up
to his retirement from active life whilst yet in the enjoyment of his
vigorous intellect, are due partly to the change which has befallen
&ldquo;the literature of fiction during the last thirty years,&rdquo; but principally
to the fact of his embracing the temperance movement with more
zeal than discretion. As a matter of fact, however, long before this
step had been taken, there had been causes equally potent at work
which seem to have escaped Mr. Bates&rsquo; attention, and these
causes, which appear to us the leading factors in the unfortunate
final result, lay, as we shall endeavour to explain, in an entirely
different direction.</p>

<p>People who knew and judged of George Cruikshank (as the
majority of his contemporaries necessarily did) by his work alone,
formed altogether an erroneous judgment of the character and
disposition of the man. Because his later designs showed or
seemed to show a love of little children, a liking for home and
homely subjects, a delight in fairy lore and legend, it seems therefore
to have been assumed that the artist was almost child-like in
simplicity, innocence, and guilelessness of heart. Some even of
those who have written upon him, acting apparently upon this impression,
have given us to understand that &ldquo;he never raised a laugh
at the expense of decency&rdquo;; that &ldquo;satire <i>never</i>, in his hands, descended
into scurrility&rdquo;; that &ldquo;a moral purpose ever underlaid his
humour&rdquo;; that &ldquo;he sought to instruct and improve whenever he
amused.&rdquo; The absurdity of this statement we have already exposed.
In reference to a supposed singleness of heart and honesty of
purpose, some writers have termed him &ldquo;honest George.&rdquo; All this
was very well. We all know, of course, that he &ldquo;never pandered to
sensuality&rdquo; or &ldquo;glorified vice&rdquo;; but in spite of these facts, &ldquo;honest
George&rdquo; himself, so far at least as we personally know, never
assumed or set up, or even aimed at assuming, that he was one whit
better than his neighbours.</p>

<p>In order that the reader may grasp the causes of his sudden decadence,
it is important that he should understand the position and
the peculiarities of the artist. As an illustrator of books he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>191</span>
dependent on a <i>clientèle</i> composed exclusively of authors and publishers.
&ldquo;Honest George,&rdquo; however, laboured under a disadvantage
common perhaps more or less to all men possessed of true genius.
Hasty and hot-tempered, particularly in matters connected with his
artistic labours, he was more than usually prone and ready to take
offence. Almost invariably at war with some one or another of his
employers, the story of George Cruikshank&rsquo;s skirmishes and quarrels
with the authors and publishers with whom he was thrown in
contact forms a most curious and interesting chapter in the history
of artistic and literary squabbles.</p>

<p>At the time when Charles Dickens began to write, George Cruikshank
had already achieved his reputation; and so well assured was
this reputation, that the young novelist in his preface to his &ldquo;Sketches
by Boz,&rdquo; speaks of the nervousness he should have experienced in
venturing <i>alone</i> before the public, and of his delight in securing the
co-operation of an artist so distinguished as George Cruikshank.
In 1838, however, the author like the artist had made his mark:
&ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Oliver Twist&rdquo; had
been written; and every vestige of the nervousness of which he speaks
in the preface to his &ldquo;Sketches&rdquo; had disappeared for ever.</p>

<p>Mr. Sala has somewhere happily remarked that Charles Dickens
wanted rather a scene painter for his novels than a mere illustrator
of books, and the very last person to answer his requirements was
George Cruikshank; for, while ready and willing to execute designs
illustrative of Mr. Dickens&rsquo;s writings, he made it an implied condition
of his retainer, that he should be free to design them in his own
way and after his own fashion. It was an <i>essential</i> condition of
George Cruikshank&rsquo;s success as a draughtsman, not only that he
should feel a sympathy for any subject he was called upon to design,
but also that his genius should be left unfettered and untrammelled
in his method of treatment. Hence it was that he found it
impossible to co-operate with so exacting an employer of artistic
labour as Charles Dickens. The latter argued, with some show of
reason, that knowing what he intended to describe, he was the fittest
and most competent person to explain how his meaning should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>192</span>
pictorially carried out. This sort of arrangement, however, did not
suit the independent and somewhat impracticable spirit of the artist,
and the result was almost a foregone conclusion. These two men
of genius inevitably clashed; and the connection between Charles
Dickens and Cruikshank was abruptly severed.</p>

<p>A singular memorial of the quarrel between Dickens and Cruikshank
will be found in the last illustration to the author&rsquo;s novel of
&ldquo;Oliver Twist,&rdquo; one of the worst that the artist ever executed.
Although Mr. Forster does not say so&mdash;and possibly would not
admit it,&mdash;Charles Dickens is directly responsible for this result, as
the reader will agree when he learns the whole of the facts, which
are only partly given in Forster&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life,&rdquo; and in every other work
which professes to tell the story.</p>

<p>The reader will not require to be told that &ldquo;Oliver Twist&rdquo; made
its appearance in the pages of &ldquo;Bentley&rsquo;s Miscellany.&rdquo; The story
of course had been written in anticipation of the magazine; and
according to Mr. Forster, Cruikshank&rsquo;s designs for the portion which
forms the third volume &ldquo;having to be executed &lsquo;in a lump,&rsquo; were
necessarily done somewhat hastily.&rdquo; How far this statement is
correct, the reader will be enabled to judge when we tell him that
these so-called &ldquo;hastily&rdquo; prepared illustrations include the famous
designs of <i>Sikes and his Dog</i> and <i>Fagin in the Condemned Cell</i>.
&ldquo;None of these illustrations,&rdquo; Mr. Forster goes on to tell us, &ldquo;Dickens
had seen until he saw them in the book on the eve of its publication
[we assume in the three-volume form], when he so strongly objected to
one of them that it had to be cancelled.&rdquo; &ldquo;My dear Cruikshank,&rdquo; he
at once wrote off to the artist, &ldquo;I returned suddenly to town yesterday
afternoon [October, 1838] to look at the latter pages of &lsquo;Oliver
Twist&rsquo; before it was delivered to the booksellers, when I saw the
majority of the plates for the first time. With reference to the last
one, <i>Rose Maylie and Oliver</i>, without entering into the question
of great haste or any other cause which may have led to its being
what it is, I am quite sure there can be little difference of opinion
between us with respect to the result. May I ask you whether you
will object to designing this plate afresh, and doing so <i>at once</i>, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>193</span>
order that as few impressions as possible of the present one may go
forth. I feel confident you know me too well to feel hurt by this
inquiry, and with equal confidence in you, I have lost no time in
preferring it.&rdquo; At this point Mr. Forster leaves the story.</p>

<p>Probably very few of our readers have seen this despised and
<span class="sn">The Quarrel with Dickens.</span>
rejected plate of <i>Rose Maylie and Oliver</i>, for it is not the one which
bears that title among the ordinary illustrations to the novel of
&ldquo;Oliver Twist.&rdquo; It is very rare, and we wish we could reproduce
it here. If not one of the very best of the series, it is entirely in
keeping with the rest; and so far from displaying &ldquo;great haste,&rdquo; is
in every respect a carefully finished book etching. Four figures are
represented in it as sitting round the fire, among them the well known
form of Oliver, with his turn-down collar and elaborately brushed
hair. On the mantle-shelf, with other ornaments, are two hyacinths
in glasses, thus fixing January as the date of the scene depicted. It
would have been better for the book if Charles Dickens had left it
alone. The artist did as he was requested, with anger at his heart;
and as a consequence, Rose Maylie will go down to posterity as
the ugliest of George Cruikshank&rsquo;s very ugly women, in an outrageous
bonnet, with her hand resting on the shoulder of a youth wearing
the singular coatee or boy&rsquo;s jacket of forty years ago. Differing
altogether from the admirable designs which preceded it, there is an
incongruity about the etching which cannot fail to impress the
observer. The unfortunate letter and still more unfortunate result
occasioned a coolness between the men which was never wholly
removed. From that time forth George Cruikshank executed no
more designs for Charles Dickens, and the illustrations to the long
series of novels which afterwards followed from the pen of the
talented but distinctly autocratic author were entrusted to other
hands. However much this result must be deplored so far as the
artist himself is concerned, the coolness between Charles Dickens
and George Cruikshank is scarcely to be viewed in the light of a misfortune
for English illustrative art. Only consider for one moment
what might have followed had the artist executed the designs to the
rest of Dickens&rsquo;s novels! Dick Swiveller would have suited him,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>194</span>
and so would Quilp, or Sampson Brass, the Yorkshire schoolmaster,
Newman Noggs, Lord Frederick Verisopht, Captain Bunsby, or even
Mr. Pecksniff himself; but only fancy, on the other hand, the
<i>horrors</i> which would have been made of Dolly Varden, of Edith
Dombey, of &ldquo;Little Em&rsquo;ly,&rdquo; of dear, gentle, loving little Nell!
Happily for the fame of George Cruikshank, his imagination was
not called into requisition for any one of these creations, and like
the &ldquo;annunciations,&rdquo; the &ldquo;beatifications,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;apotheoses&rdquo; of
Lockhart, they remain (we are thankful to say it) still unrealized!</p>

<p>The quarrel with Dickens was followed by a very bitter and very
<span class="sn">The Feud with Bentley.</span>
singular feud between the artist and Bentley. Into the causes of
that quarrel we need not enter; suffice it to say that to the misunderstanding
we owe some of the very worst etchings which Cruikshank
ever designed, the series of illustrations to Harrison Ainsworth&rsquo;s
novel of &ldquo;Guy Fawkes.&rdquo; The worst of all is the <i>Vision of Guy
Fawkes at Saint Winifred&rsquo;s Well</i>, and a very singular &ldquo;vision&rdquo; it is.
The saint has all the appearance, with all the grace, expression, and
symmetry of a Dutch doll arrayed in a pocket handkerchief; the
sky is &ldquo;machine ruled;&rdquo; the pillars and tracery of the ruined chapel
are architectural impossibilities; while at the very first snort, the
slumbering figure of Guy Fawkes must roll inevitably into the well
towards the brink of which he lies in dangerous propinquity. These
illustrations provoked the ire of the publisher and the remonstrances
of the author, both of which were disregarded with strict impartiality.
In 1842, Harrison Ainsworth retired from the conduct of the
&ldquo;Miscellany,&rdquo; and set up a rival magazine of somewhat similar plan
and conception, which he christened after his own surname. This
opposition venture appears to have been the result of a misunderstanding
between the editor and publisher, the most serious outcome
of which was, that when Ainsworth left he carried with him George
Cruikshank.</p>

<p>The secession of George caused Mr. Bentley the greatest possible
inconvenience. The straits to which he was reduced may be
imagined by the fact that A. Hervieu (an artist of considerable
ability), and the clever, well-known amateur, Alfred Crowquill (Alfred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>195</span>
Henry Forrester), had to be pressed into the service, and contributed
leading etchings. Meanwhile, the cover of the &ldquo;Miscellany&rdquo; showed
that George Cruikshank was nominally retained on the pictorial staff;
and before the quality of his illustrations became so villainously bad
that the object he had in view&mdash;that of <i>forcing</i> Bentley to cancel his
engagement&mdash;had been attained, a draughtsman of unusual graphic
power and versatility had come to the assistance of the magazine.
This was a young man who had already executed many comic
designs of a somewhat novel and original character, and was already
forcing his way to the front: his name&mdash;familiar afterwards &ldquo;in our
mouths as household words&ldquo;&mdash;was John Leech.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Guy Fawkes&rdquo; illustrations were the outcome of the first
campaign between Bentley and Cruikshank; and as the history of the
quarrel between the publisher and his unmanageable artist is a somewhat
amusing one, we may be pardoned for describing it at length.
The engagement from which he sought to free himself, and which he
stigmatized as &ldquo;a one-sided one,&rdquo; obliged Cruikshank to supply Mr.
Bentley with at least one etching every month; and as Bentley continued
to advertise him as the illustrator of the &ldquo;Miscellany,&rdquo; George
commenced the second campaign by issuing in the opening pages
of the opposition venture the following characteristic manifesto:&mdash;&ldquo;Mr.
Bentley, the publisher,&rdquo; says the indignant George, &ldquo;evidently
wishes to create the supposition that <i>I</i> illustrate his &lsquo;Miscellany.&rsquo;
On the contrary, I wish the public to understand that I do no such
thing. It is true that, according to a one-sided agreement (of which
more may be heard hereafter), I supply a single etching per month.
But I supply <i>only that single etching</i>. And even that can hardly be
called my design, since <i>the subject of it</i> is regularly furnished to me
by Mr. Bentley, and I have never even read a page of any of the
stories thus &lsquo;<i>illustrated</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet Mr. Bentley not only advertises me as the illustrator of his
&rsquo;Miscellany,&rsquo; but he has lately shaped his advertisement thus, in
the papers as well as on the wrapper of his magazine: &lsquo;Illustrated
by Geo. Cruikshank, etc.&rsquo; Are his other artists worthy only of
being merged in an etc.? This is, indeed, paying them but a poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>196</span>
compliment; and one which I should hardly think they would
submit to. In certain other announcements I observe mentioned,
in addition to my own name, a &lsquo;Cruikshank the Younger.&rsquo; Who is
he? The only Cruikshank the Younger I ever heard of as a
designer, is myself. Would it not be supposed that there must be
a third Cruikshank, etching, drawing, and &lsquo;illustrating,&rsquo; as his two
predecessors have done? Yet there is no such person! There is
indeed a nephew of mine, who, as a <i>wood-engraver</i>, and a wood-engraver
<i>only</i>, has been employed by Mr. Bentley to engrave
&rsquo;Crowquill&rsquo;s designs;&rsquo; just as in my &lsquo;Omnibus&rsquo; he engraved
my own drawings upon wood, and still does engrave them in
&rsquo;Ainsworth&rsquo;s Magazine.&rsquo; Now, can any one imagine it possible for
any respectable publisher, especially &lsquo;Her Majesty&rsquo;s Publisher in
Ordinary,&rsquo; to be guilty of so miserable a trick, so wretched an expedient,
as that of putting off the <i>engraver</i> of a few of the drawings
as the designer himself&mdash;as one of the &lsquo;illustrators&rsquo; of the &lsquo;Miscellany&rsquo;?
Let Mr. Bentley but produce a single design for the
&rsquo;Miscellany,&rsquo; by &lsquo;Cruikshank the Younger&rsquo; (by him so-called), and
I will retract this indignant disclaimer and apologise. If Mr.
Bentley cannot do this, he stands self-convicted of an attempt to
impose upon the public by a mystification, for purposes as apparent
as the trick itself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What this strange declaration of war proposed to effect is not
altogether manifest; if its author imagined it would produce the
result of releasing him from his engagement, he was signally mistaken,
for Mr. Bentley, as might have been expected, held him all
the tighter to the <i>letter</i> of his bond. What the artist thought and
what he did are told us in the plainest language by the etchings
which followed this singular manifesto. They tell us as plainly as
could be expressed in words, that George reasoned after the following
fashion:&mdash;&ldquo;It is clear that under the terms of my engagement
I am bound to supply &lsquo;Bentley&rsquo;s Miscellany&rsquo; with one etching
a month; but our agreement says nothing as to the <i>quality</i> of
the etchings, nor am I bound to see that they shall be strictly
relevant to the subjects which I am called upon to illustrate.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>197</span>
From that time, so long as he continued to design for the &ldquo;Miscellany,&rdquo;
George tried to do his worst, and it must be admitted that
he succeeded to admiration. Anything more outrageous than these
wretched drawings&mdash;taking into account the talent, power, and skill
of the artist, and the quality of the work which he was at this very
time executing for Harrison Ainsworth&mdash;can scarcely be conceived.
They are so ashamed of themselves, that his signature&mdash;usually so
distinct, so characteristic, and so clear on other occasions&mdash;is
illegible, in many cases wholly wanting. At length, in vol. xiii.
(1843) appeared a story called &ldquo;The Exile of Louisiana,&rdquo; &ldquo;with an
illustration by George Cruikshank&rdquo; (for Bentley, probably by way of
retaliation, was determined the public should know that these performances
were due to the hand which had produced the famous
etchings to &ldquo;Oliver Twist,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jack Sheppard,&rdquo; and the contemporaneous
story of the &ldquo;Miser&rsquo;s Daughter&rdquo;). We should like to
have seen the face of the author when this extraordinary conception
dawned upon him. The tale (a serious and pathetic one) was
burlesqued with one of the most grotesque caricatures the mind of
comic artist ever conceived. It represents Marshal Saxe recognising
the widow of a late Czaaravitch in the gardens of the Tuileries.
The marshal, a most extraordinary personage, would make in actual
life the fortune of any enterprising showman. He possesses a nose
of Slawkenbergian proportions; his pig-tail reaches below his waist;
and his sword, sticking out at right angles, gives him the appearance
of a fly with a pin through its middle. Near him stands a courtier,
with ankles of such fearful and wonderful construction that his legs
will snap the moment he attempts to use them. As for the distinguished
relict of the Czaaravitch, she is one of the most wonderful
of the many wonderful people who figure in the sketch. Her
figure is an anatomical impossibility; while her mouth reaches from
ear to ear (the letterpress, by the way, informs us that her deceased
husband had married her for her beauty!). The statue of Mercury,
posed like a scaramouch at a masquerade, is matched by that of
Neptune, who whirls his trident round his head in a state of the
wildest hilarity, cutting at the same time a caper over the body of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>198</span>
an attendant dolphin, who is so overcome with the whimsicality of
the proceeding that he is making the most violent efforts to restrain
his laughter. This last shot probably hit the mark, for only three
etchings appear in vol. xiv., and not one afterwards. George was
victorious; but there are victories and victories, and a triumph won
at the cost of an artistic reputation is as disastrous as a defeat.</p>

<p>Harrison Ainsworth&rsquo;s long connection with the artist had taught
<span class="sn">The Misunderstanding with Ainsworth.</span>
him that he was one who would be neither driven nor led, and he
was wise enough to accommodate himself to circumstances. The
admirable woodcut design at the head of that division of the
magazine which was known as &ldquo;Our Library Table,&rdquo; shows us the
artist and the handsome editor in consultation, and the attitude of
the two men is indicative of the fact that Ainsworth is attentively
listening to the advice or suggestions of his coadjutor, a fact to
which Cruikshank himself has been particular to draw our attention.
To the free and unfettered conditions under which Cruikshank
co-operated with Ainsworth we owe a series of the most justly celebrated
and valuable of his designs. In matters, however, connected
with art, Cruikshank was, as we have seen, a difficult man to get
on with, and it was fairly safe to predict that a quarrel between the
author and artist was a mere question of time. The artist remained
on the staff of &ldquo;Ainsworth&rsquo;s Magazine&rdquo; for three years, enriching
its pages with some of the choicest efforts of his pencil. At the end
of that period came the unfortunate but almost unavoidable misunderstanding;
and George Cruikshank, as he had done with
Bentley, withdrew from the concern. Unlike Bentley, however,
Ainsworth appears not only to have foreseen, but to have made
preparations for the inevitable; and accordingly, when George
Cruikshank retired, his place was immediately taken by an artist of
talent, destined to win for himself a considerable position among
the ranks of designers and etchers: this was Hablot Knight Browne,
then and now known to us under his monosyllabic <i>nom-de-guerre</i>
of <i>Phiz</i>.</p>

<p>It seems to us fitting in this place to say a few words on the
subject of George&rsquo;s pretension to be the originator of two of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>199</span>
Ainsworth&rsquo;s stories, because the truth of his assertion has been
questioned by a late commentator.<a name="FnAnchor_94" href="#Footnote_94"><span class="sp">94</span></a> George&rsquo;s statements simply
amount to this: that so far as the illustrations to the &ldquo;Miser&rsquo;s
Daughter&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Tower of London&rdquo; are concerned, the author
wrote up to <i>his</i> designs. We have considered Ainsworth&rsquo;s answers
to this statement, and find that although he fences with, he does
not deny it. It was one essential condition of Cruikshank&rsquo;s success
that his fancy should be free and untrammelled, and the truth of
his statement appears to us to be proved by the illustrations to
these works, which are certainly the finest which he ever designed;
that he was therefore (as he stated) the originator of these tales in
the sense in which he used the word, we can entertain no manner
of doubt.</p>

<p>Most of the Cruikshank commentators, whilst writing on the subject
of the Harrison Ainsworth etchings, have thought fit to decry
the author&rsquo;s share of the performance; but the fact that the pictures
are so much better than the letterpress should not prevent us from
dealing fairly with the veteran author, who, like the distinguished
artist with whom he so long co-operated, has now gone to his
rest. Even Mr. Ainsworth&rsquo;s detractors will, we think, admit that
without him we should have lost the admirable illustrations to
&ldquo;Windsor Castle,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jack Sheppard,&rdquo; and &ldquo;St. James&rsquo;s&rdquo;; it may
even be doubted whether without him we should have had the
still better series of etchings which adorn the &ldquo;Tower of London&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Miser&rsquo;s Daughter.&rdquo; If this be the fact, it seems to us we
owe a lasting debt of gratitude to this venerable writer, who experienced
the vicissitudes which inevitably befall mere talent when
allied with genius. He was a writer of the George Payne Ransford
James school, dispensing, however, with the inevitable setting sun and
two travellers, and received a price for his productions which many
a better author might well envy. For his novel of &ldquo;Old St. Paul&rsquo;s&rdquo;
(1841) he was paid by the proprietors of the <i>Sunday Times</i> one
thousand pounds; &ldquo;The Miser&rsquo;s Daughter&rdquo; attained an extraordinary
success; and the same remark applies to &ldquo;Windsor Castle.&rdquo; For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>200</span>
&ldquo;The Lancashire Witches&rdquo; he received from the proprietors of the
<i>Sunday Times</i> one thousand pounds. Several of the works named had
not the benefit of Cruikshank&rsquo;s illustrations; but in 1850-1, cheap
editions of all such of Mr. Ainsworth&rsquo;s romances and tales as had
appeared up to that period, were published by Messrs. Chapman and
Hall without any illustrations at all. &ldquo;Windsor Castle&rdquo; was the first
of the series, and upwards of thirty thousand copies were disposed
of in a short time; while all the other works enjoyed a very large
sale, and popular favour was so far from being exhausted, that
another edition of his novels was called for in 1864-1868. He was
a veritable literary rolling stone. In 1845 he disposed of his magazine
to the publishers, and purchased the &ldquo;New Monthly,&rdquo; previously
edited by Theodore Hook and (after his death) by Thomas
Hood; in 1854 he bought the far-famed &ldquo;Miscellany&rdquo; itself,
becoming its proprietor and editor; in that year he seems also to
have re-purchased &ldquo;Ainsworth&rsquo;s Magazine,&rdquo; which as a separate
and rival publication thenceforth ceased to exist.</p>

<p>The only work which Cruikshank illustrated for Charles Lever
was &ldquo;Arthur O&rsquo;Leary,&rdquo; and the reason of this has been explained
by himself in a letter which he wrote to Mr. Fitzpatrick, the
author of Charles Lever&rsquo;s life: &ldquo;I had the honour and the
pleasure,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;of being personally acquainted with the late
Charles Lever, and I regret that I was only able to illustrate one of
his works, &lsquo;Arthur O&rsquo;Leary,&rsquo; my engagements on &lsquo;Jack Sheppard,&rsquo;
etc., at that time prevented me from illustrating his other works,
which he wished me to have done, but I do not remember
ever having any written correspondence with him, as the MS. or
printed matter was placed in my hands for illustration; and then I
had entirely to deal with the publisher. Mr. Charles Lever was
an author whom I held in high estimation.&rdquo;  Lever himself was
highly gratified with these illustrations.</p>

<p>By 1845, that is to say, at least two years before he had taken
<span class="sn">The Final Leap in the Dark.</span>
his final leap in the dark, Cruikshank had contrived to pick
quarrels with the very class of men whom it was his special
interest to conciliate, and had been driven to set up an opposition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>201</span>
serial of his own&mdash;the celebrated &ldquo;Table Book&ldquo;&mdash;which, notwithstanding
the superlative excellence of his own illustrations and
the talent of his literary contributors, comprising such names as
John Oxenford, Horace Mayhew, Shirley Brooks, Mark Lemon,
W. M. Thackeray, and others, could not manage to prolong its
existence beyond its first volume. In matters connected with
his own interests he was not only impracticable, but seems to have
been remarkably destitute of tact and even of discernment. It
cannot be doubted that the estrangement from Bentley was unwise
and impolitic, for as one of the greatest publishers of fiction
of the day, his influence was both far-reaching and comprehensive.
In quarrelling with Dickens, Ainsworth, and Bentley, three of the
great artistic employers of labour of his time, and in face of the
growing popularity of John Leech and Hablot Knight Browne,
he was literally quarrelling with his bread and butter, and few
men, even of genius, may afford to do that. He was essentially
impulsive, and frequently acted under the influence of first impressions.
Although fond of his pipe and his glass, as his famous
<i>Reverie</i>,&mdash;<i>The Triumph of Cupid</i>, in the &ldquo;Table Book,&rdquo; will
show, he had always evinced a horror of drink, and had, as we
have seen, done his best at various times to expose its insidious
and baneful influences. At last, in 1847, came a sudden and
extraordinary impulse of enthusiasm, under the influence of which
he not only produced his <i>Bottle</i>, but laid aside for ever his pipe
and his bowl. To do any real good, he said he must practise
what he preached: he joined the &ldquo;teetotallers,&rdquo; and not being
one of those who did things by halves, entered heart and soul
into the crusade against drink by becoming a temperance advocate.
This last was the one step needed to fill up the measure of the
artist&rsquo;s folly, and to secure for him the reputation of being an
incurably eccentric, self-willed man.</p>

<p>Those who would charge the author with blaming George
Cruikshank for joining the ranks of the teetotallers will do him
grave injustice. Although very much of the opinion of Robert
Burton, author of the &ldquo;Anatomy of Melancholy,&rdquo; that, &ldquo;No verses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>202</span>
can please men or live long that are written by water-drinkers,&rdquo;
and disposed to undervalue the tact and discretion of some of
the advocates of total abstinence, for its abstract principles he can
say and think nothing but what is good.  But he is writing,
be it remembered, of a great artist&mdash;one whose mission was that
of an artist, not that of a <i>temperance orator</i>,&mdash;of one who had
served the righteous and good cause of temperance <i>best</i> when
he remembered that genius had made him an artist and not a
temperance orator,&mdash;of one who had rendered that cause yeoman&rsquo;s
service long before he joined the total abstainers, in designing
<i>The Gin Juggernaut</i>, <i>The Gin Trap</i>, and work of a kindred
nature. The cause, too, so far as mere verbal advocacy was concerned,
was better served by men of vastly inferior mark and
ability. Before this fatal plunge was taken his genius had roamed
in an absolutely uncontrolled range of freedom.  He had travelled
into the land of chivalry and romance, into the realms of fairy
fancy, magic, and diablery; he had brought back with him
pictures of the wondrous people, lands, and scenes which his
fancy had visited. All this was at an end; this wonderful genius
was now forced into a narrow groove, where it could no longer
have the freedom of action which was essential to its very existence.
From the moment that George Cruikshank turned temperance
<i>orator</i>, the world of English art lost one of its brightest ornaments,
and he himself both fame and fortune; for, as Mr. Bates observes,
&ldquo;some of his earliest friends were alienated, and remunerative
work that might have been his was diverted, from sheer prejudice,
into other hands.&rdquo;  His style, too, as Mr. Bates further remarks,
&ldquo;suffered by the contraction of his ideas and sympathies, and
his art became associated with that vulgarity and want of æstheticism
which perhaps necessarily characterizes the movement.&rdquo;  <i>The
Bottle</i> and <i>The Drunkard&rsquo;s Children</i>, although successful in a
pecuniary point of view&mdash;compared with what had gone before,&mdash;can
scarcely be called <i>art</i> at all; in these too he unconsciously
put himself in competition with Hogarth, and as a matter of
necessity failed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>203</span></p>

<p>He had been a king among designers and etchers; he had
been and was still an admirable water-colour artist, but knew
comparatively little of the manipulation or management of oils.
A new crusade had however to be preached, to be preached by
means of an oil painting; and for this purpose George was to
be inspired off hand (so to speak) with a new art, and to paint a
picture in oils. We know the result&mdash;the lamentable result&mdash;in that
most preposterous <i>Worship of Bacchus</i>. His motive was good,
his ideas were vast, but the <i>genius</i> which in his unregenerate days
had enabled him to design <i>The Gin Trap</i> and the <i>The Gin Juggernaut</i>,
was no longer there. Unhappy Rip! There is more poetry&mdash;more
fancy&mdash;more romance&mdash;more art&mdash;fire&mdash;genius in one of the
little &ldquo;bits,&rdquo; nine inches by six, executed in the days of his pipe
and his glass, than in any one part or portion of this most gigantic
failure.</p>

<p>The mere fact of his joining the ranks of the total abstainers
would have done him perhaps little professional mischief, had he
been content simply to join them, and aid their cause, as he
had once so graphically done by depicting the evils of gin drinking
and intemperance; but it was one of the failings as well as one
of the virtues of this impulsive, earnest man&rsquo;s character, that
whatever his hand found to do, &ldquo;he did it with his might.&rdquo;
Desiring to aid them to the best of his power, he mistook the
means by which that aid might best be applied, and forgot that
his talents lay not in the tongue but in his hand and his head.
We look upon George Cruikshank after 1849, no longer as an artist,
but as a very indifferent temperance lecturer. The reign of Fancy
was over. Thenceforth no &ldquo;Reveries,&rdquo; no &ldquo;Jack o&rsquo; Lanterns,&rdquo;
no &ldquo;Gin Juggernauts,&rdquo; would come from that indefatigable
hand, that fertile brain, that wondrous and facile pencil. George
Cruikshank took his <i>Worship of Bacchus</i>, and went out into the
world (heaven save the mark!) as a temperance lecturer. His
literary abilities were, however, small; he lacked even that &ldquo;gentle
dulness&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_95" href="#Footnote_95"><span class="sp">95</span></a> which characterizes the leading advocates of the movement,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>204</span>
and kindles a certain amount of sympathetic enthusiasm in
kindred breasts. The dull people who went to hear him, knew
little about and cared less for art and genius than they did for
the abstract doctrines of total abstinence. The result, so far as
he personally was concerned, was curious, lamentable, and almost
instantaneous. The work which had hitherto crowded upon him
fell away like water from a leaking vessel; nay, on the authority
of Mr. William Bates, when work was offered him he refused to
take it. &ldquo;When pressed by the late Mark Lemon to draw on
his own terms for <i>Punch</i>,&rdquo; this man who had designed some of
the broadest, coarsest, most personal of the satires of the nineteenth
century, had grown so extremely particular that &ldquo;he definitely
refused to have anything to do with it on account of what he
termed its personalities.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_96" href="#Footnote_96"><span class="sp">96</span></a> What could be done for such a man
as this? Authors and publishers wholly ceased to employ him;
and he was left without work in the very pride of his artistic
career. He turned to oil painting; was taken by the hand by
the influential few who appreciated, pitied, and loved him; but
from the moment that he became a temperance advocate, to the
literary world and to the general public this most singular and
original genius was to all practical intents and purposes&mdash;dead.</p>

<p>These observations, I repeat, are made in no spirit of hostility
to the sincere and earnest men who would seek to reduce the
crime and misery which owe their origin to the immoderate use
of ardent spirits. So far from this being the case, I hold their
cause to be so righteous, so sensible, that it seems to me as
effectually advocated by a plain, simple, earnest man as by a great
artist and man of genius. I say advisedly, that the cause of
temperance had been better served had Cruikshank stuck to his
pencil and his etching needle, instead of seeking the position of a
temperance advocate, and stumping the provinces with his absurd
panorama of <i>The Worship of Bacchus</i>.</p>

<p>Thirty years of quite sterling and admirable work were now to
be followed by thirty years of artistic sterility, for from this Rip
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>205</span>
Van Winkle slumber of thirty years&rsquo; duration his reputation never
once awoke. Out of the dreary desert of mental and artistic
inactivity came forth at long distant intervals specimens of his
handiwork, which served, it is true, to remind us of what he once
was capable, but failed to restore him to the place he had for
ever lost in public estimation; such were the illustrations to Angus
Bethune Reach&rsquo;s &ldquo;Clement Lorymer,&rdquo; to Robert Brough&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life of
Sir John Falstaff,&rdquo; to Smedley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Frank Fairleigh,&rdquo; to George Raymond&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Life and Enterprises of Elliston,&rdquo; to his own <i>so-called</i>
&ldquo;Fairy Library.&rdquo; Good and excellent as this work was, it utterly
failed to lend even a passing vitality to his departed reputation,
a fact sufficiently and vexatiously proved when he essayed once
more to start a magazine of his own, which met with such little
encouragement that <i>only two parts were issued</i>.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the designs of the &ldquo;Life of Falstaff&rdquo; and his own
&ldquo;Fairy Library&rdquo; showed that, when the subject took hold of his
fancy, the hand of Cruikshank had not altogether lost the cunning
which characterized it in days of yore. To illustrate the so-called
fairy stories, he had to read them,&mdash;no longer, alas! with his former
love of fairy lore and legend,&mdash;no longer with the mind of a man
free, vigorous, elastic, but with a mind warped and prejudiced
with the study of a theme which was intellectually depressing and
uninspiring. No one knows the origin of these fairy stories, they
come to us from our Danish and Saxon ancestors, but are interwoven
with the literature of every civilized nation under the sun,
and are altogether beyond the sphere of modern criticism. Their
primitive style is singularly adapted to enlist the sympathies of the
little folk to whom they specially address themselves: their highest
aim and object is not to instruct, but to amuse. All this the
artist, in the ardour of his new crusade, lost sight of, and so dead
had he become to the fairy fancies and reveries of his youth,
that he placed sacrilegious hands on these time-honoured and
favourite legends of our childhood, and converted them (with most
indifferent literary ability) into something little better than temperance
<i>tracts</i>!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>206</span></p>

<p>But happily not without protest. Charles Dickens, the champion
of the injured fairies, set his lance in rest, and speedily rolled
hapless Van Winkle in the dust. Into the details of this very
absurd and very unequal contest there is no necessity for us to
enter. George was at home with his pencil, his etching needle, or
his tubes of water colour; but put a pen in his hand, and he forthwith
would cut the funniest of capers. He argued (with every
appearance of comical gravity and earnestness), that because Shakespeare
might alter an Italian story, or Sir Walter Scott use history
for the purposes of the drama, poetry, or romance, therefore,
&ldquo;any one might take the liberty of altering a common fairy story
to suit his purpose and convey his opinions.&rdquo; Aye, and so he
might, honest Rip; but he would set about his task in a very
different fashion to Shakespeare or Sir Walter Scott, and I fear
too that the literary results and value would be vastly different. It
never seemed to occur to the mind of the honest but simple casuist
that in putting &ldquo;any one&rdquo; on a par with William Shakespeare and
Sir Walter Scott, he was writing simple nonsense.</p>

<p>It is clear, therefore, that the change which had come over the
literature of fiction during the past quarter of a century, and which
Professor Bates would assign as one of the principal causes of
the sterility which <span class="correction" title="amended from befel">befell</span> the genius of Cruikshank, had really very
little to do with it. This calamity&mdash;for a national calamity it undoubtedly
was&mdash;did not fall upon him, be it remembered, when he
was old, but in the very acme and pride of artistic success. His fall
was distinctly due to causes which were within his own control,
and might have been avoided by the exercise of qualities which (it
seems to me) he did not possess,&mdash;forethought, tact, and judgment.
During the rest of his long life, the place which George Cruikshank
deliberately ceded to others he never once regained; when he
dropped behind, he became as completely forgotten as if he had
ceased any longer to exist; men whose childhood he had delighted
with his quaint imaginings, his own friends and contemporaries, died
off; and so it came to pass, that before he knew it, for time moves
quickly after youth is over, the old man was left standing alone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>207</span>
amongst the ranks of a generation that did not know him. So little
was he known or regarded, that when his works were <i>first</i> exhibited,
no one took the trouble to see them; and when a small circle of
admirers, with the great English critic, John Ruskin, at their head,
started a subscription for the forgotten artist, &ldquo;the attempt was a
failure&mdash;hundreds being received when thousands were expected.&rdquo;
It will be remembered that in his best days the artist had executed
a memorable etching, <i>Born a Genius and Born a Dwarf</i>: I wonder
whether, in the bitterness of his spirit and the righteousness of his
anger, George Cruikshank ever thought of that etching?</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<h5><i>ROBERT SEYMOUR.</i></h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Decidedly</span> next in order of merit to George Cruikshank, amongst
his own contemporaries, if we except only Theodore Lane, comes
Robert Seymour. With a style and manner peculiar to himself,
and a power of invention and realization which amounted almost
to genius, Seymour was superior in every respect to Robert Cruikshank,
with whom we find him not unfrequently associated in comic
design. This style and manner were clearly founded on those of
George Cruikshank; and when he selected (as he not unfrequently
did) subjects which had been treated by the latter, the work of this
most able draughtsman will bear even favourable comparison with
that of the great original whom he chose as his master. That he
drew his inspiration from and sought even to emulate Cruikshank,
is shown by the fact that to some of his earlier caricatures he
affixed the name of &ldquo;Shortshanks,&rdquo; a practice which he discontinued
on receiving a remonstrance from the irritable George.</p>

<p>Robert Seymour was born in 1798. Henry Seymour, his father,
a gentleman of good family in Somersetshire, meeting with misfortune,
removed to London, and apprenticed him to Mr. Vaughan,
a pattern designer of Duke Street, Smithfield. This Vaughan seems
to deserve a passing notice here by reason of the fact that his
father is said to have received proposals for partnership from the
father of the late Sir Robert Peel, which were rejected, on the
ground that the fortunes of the Peel family were not then considered
particularly flourishing. How far this statement may be correct we
know not. Assuming it to be true, the fortunes of the Peel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>209</span>
family afterwards took a turn which probably frequently gave
Vaughan <i>père</i> (if he lived to ruminate thereon) some serious cause
for reflection as well as of repentance.</p>

<p>Like Hogarth, with whom this artist, like all other comic designers,
has been frequently and improperly compared, young Robert
Seymour declined to waste his abilities as a mere mechanical
draughtsman, and used his technical education as a means of
cultivating the artistic gifts with which nature and inclination had
endowed him. He seems at first to have selected a walk in art
which required for its ultimate success a larger amount of application
and patience than he could well spare for the purpose. Shortly
after the expiration of his indentures, he started as a painter in
oils, and executed several pictures, one of which (a Biblical subject)
included, it is said, no less than one hundred figures, whilst a no less
ambitious subject than Tasso&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jerusalem Delivered&rdquo; was deemed
of sufficient merit to be exhibited on the walls of the Royal Academy.
Other pictorial subjects were taken from &ldquo;Don Quixote,&rdquo; &ldquo;Waverley,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Tempest,&rdquo; etc., besides which he executed numerous
portraits and miniatures. These efforts, however, do not appear
to have been sufficiently remunerative to encourage him to continue
them, and after a time he resigned them to follow a branch of art
more congenial, perhaps, to his abilities, and thenceforth very
rapidly acquired fame as a social satirist and caricaturist.</p>

<p>The coloured caricatures of Robert Seymour, besides being comparatively
scarce and little known, seem hardly to call for any
particular description; the titles of some of them will be found
mentioned in our Appendix. One which has survived, and with
which the public are probably most familiar, is one of the worst of
the series. It is entitled, <i>Going it by Steam</i>, is signed &ldquo;Short
Shanks,&rdquo; and was published by King. Among rarer and better
ones may be named two very excellent specimens, without date,
published by Creed, of Chancery Lane, labelled respectively, <i>A
Musical Genius</i> (a butcher boy playing on the Pandean pipes and
accompanying himself with marrow bone and cleaver), and <i>A Man
of Taste and Feeling</i> (a tramp caught in a trap while helping himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>210</span>
in a butler&rsquo;s pantry). Among the best of his coloured political
caricatures, we may mention, <i>Greece and her Rough Lovers</i> (<i>i.e.</i>
Russia and Turkey), published by Maclean, in 1828. Lithography
afforded greater facilities of execution than the old process, and
much of Seymour&rsquo;s work in political as well as social satire was
executed by himself on stone.</p>

<p>The year 1830 brought the life and reign of George the Fourth to
<span class="sn">Death of George IV.</span>
a close. He had been breaking up for a long time past. The first
entry of any moment occurs in Mr. Greville&rsquo;s diary, of 25th August,
1828: &ldquo;The king has not been well; he goes fishing and dining at
Virginia Water, stays out late, and catches cold.&rdquo; A year later, the
diarist relates that the king had nearly lost his eyesight, and would
be &ldquo;couched&rdquo; as soon as his eyes were in a proper state for the
operation. On the 7th of December he attended a chapter of the
Bath, &ldquo;looked well,&rdquo; but was so blind that &ldquo;he could not see to read
the list, and begged [Mr. Greville] to read it for him.&rdquo; The Sangrado
treatment was then in full force; and we find that in
January, 1830, the king, being very ill, &ldquo;lost forty ounces of blood.&rdquo;
He grew at last so much worse that the preparations for the festivities
with which the royal birthday was to have been celebrated were
obliged to be postponed <i>sine die</i>. A victim to dropsy, the operation
of puncturing the legs was resorted to, with the result of giving him
temporary relief. The patient, however, became liable to violent fits
of coughing, in one of which he ruptured a blood vessel, and expired
early on the morning of Saturday the 26th of June, 1830.</p>

<p>A more contemptible, selfish, unfeeling being as a <i>man</i> than this
king could scarcely have been found, &ldquo;a mixture of narrow-mindedness,
selfishness, truckling, blustering, and duplicity, with no object
but self, his own ease, and the gratification of his own fancies and
prejudices.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_97" href="#Footnote_97"><span class="sp">97</span></a> &ldquo;A more despicable scene,&rdquo; continues Mr. Greville,
&ldquo;cannot be exhibited than that which the interior of our Court
presents&mdash;every base, low, and unmanly propensity, with selfishness,
avarice, and a life of petty intrigue and mystery.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_98" href="#Footnote_98"><span class="sp">98</span></a> George the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>211</span>
Fourth as king and regent was recklessly extravagant, but his expenditure
was always upon self or the gratification of self. A hundred
examples of his selfish nature might be given, but <i>cui bono</i>?
Everything he could get hold of, which could minister to his own
personal gratification, he <i>grasped</i> with avidity. In this spirit he
appropriated the jewels and spent on himself the whole of the money
belonging to his late father&rsquo;s estate, amounting to £120,000. His
ministers did not dare to oppose his greed, or tell him that this
money belonged to the Crown, and not to himself as an individual.
He acted precisely in the same manner with regard to his mother&rsquo;s
jewels, of which she possessed a large quantity. Those she received
from George III. she left by will to the king; the rest she gave to
her daughters; in spite of which bequest, her selfish son appropriated
the whole to himself as his own personal private property.</p>

<p>An admirable likeness of this most selfish of royal or private personages
<span class="sn">Portrait of the King.</span>
has been drawn by a master hand. &ldquo;To make a portrait of
him,&rdquo; says Thackeray, &ldquo;at first seemed a matter of small difficulty.
There is his coat, his star, his wig, his countenance simpering under
it: with a slate and a piece of chalk, I could at this very desk perform
a recognisable likeness of him. And yet after reading of him
in scores of volumes, hunting him through old magazines and newspapers,
having him here at a ball, there at a public dinner, there
at races, and so forth, you find you have nothing&mdash;nothing but a
coat and wig, and a mask smiling below it&mdash;nothing but a great
simulacrum. His sire and grandsires were men. One knew what
they were like: what they would do in given circumstances: that on
occasion they fought and demeaned themselves like tough, good
soldiers. They had friends whom they liked according to their
natures; enemies whom they hated firmly; passions and actions and
individualities of their own. The sailor king who came after George
was a man; the Duke of York was a man, big, burly, loud, jolly,
cursing, courageous. But this George, what was he? I look through
all his life, and recognise but a bow and a grin. I try and take him
to pieces, and find silk stockings, padding, stays, a coat with frogs
and a fur collar, a star and blue ribbon, a pocket-handkerchief prodigiously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>212</span>
scented, one of Truefitt&rsquo;s best nutty brown wigs reeking
with oil, a set of teeth, and a huge black stock, under-waistcoats,
more under-waistcoats, and then nothing.&rdquo; &ldquo;Under-waistcoats, more
under-waistcoats&mdash;and then nothing!&rdquo; Yes, there was something
besides the silk stockings&mdash;the padding&mdash;the stays&mdash;the coat with
frogs and a fur collar, the star and the blue ribbon, although there
might be nothing underneath which resembled a heart or which was
capable of being inspired by a feeling which had not its origin in <i>self</i>.
The wardrobe of this royal professor of deportment, who ten years
before had been described to his own great personal annoyance as&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;The dandy of sixty, who bows with a grace,</p>
<p class="i05">And has taste in wigs, collars, cuirasses, and lace,&rdquo;</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">was sold on the 2nd of August, 1830, and is said to have been
sufficiently numerous to fill Monmouth Street, and sufficiently
various and splendid for the wardrobe of Drury Lane Theatre. The
meanness of his disposition was exhibited even in the matter of his
clothes, scarcely any of which he gave away except his linen, which
was distributed every year. Here were all the coats which this monarch
had had for fifty years before, three hundred whips, canes without
number, every sort of uniform, the costumes of all the order of
Europe, splendid fur pelisses, hunting coats and breeches; among
other etcetera, a dozen pair of corduroy breeches made to hunt in
when Don Miguel was in London. His profusion in these articles was
explained by the fact that he never paid for them; but his memory
in relation to them was nevertheless so accurate that he recollected
every article of dress, no matter how old, and his pages were liable
to be called on at any moment to produce some particular coat or
other article of apparel of years gone by.</p>

<p>The demise of this treasurer of royal antique raiment was
followed by an order for general <i>mourning</i>, to which a caricature
drawing by Seymour has reference, the satirical meaning of which
will be apparent after the explanation previously given. A colossal
military figure armed with a baton, on which is inscribed the word
&ldquo;fashion,&rdquo; encounters at dusk, in Hyde Park, a solitary pedestrian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>213</span>
habited in a suit of grey clothing. &ldquo;How dare you appear,&rdquo; says
the apparition, &ldquo;without a black coat?&rdquo; to which the frightened
pedestrian replies, &ldquo;The <i>tailor</i> would not trust me, sir.&rdquo; In August,
1830, he gives likenesses of the new king and queen, William the
Fourth and Adelaide, surrounded by a halo of glory. The new king,
in reference to his profession, and by way of obvious contrast to his
predecessor, is subsequently depicted as an anchor labelled, &ldquo;England&rsquo;s
best bower not <i>a maker of bows</i>.&rdquo; From other contemporary
pictorial skits by Seymour we learn that various changes were made
in the royal establishment, and the new queen seems to have
addressed herself specially to a reform in the dresses of the court
domestics. On the 1st of October, 1830, Seymour represents her
grinding an enormous machine, called the &ldquo;Adelaide Mill,&rdquo; into
which the women servants, dressed in the outrageous head-gear and
leg-of-mutton sleeves of the period, are perforce ascending, and
issuing from the other side attired in plain and more suitable
apparel. &ldquo;No silk gowns,&rdquo; says Her Majesty as she turns the handle.
&ldquo;No French curls; and I&rsquo;ll have you all wear aprons.&rdquo; The new
queen seems also to have shown a disposition to encourage native
manufactures and produce at the expense of French and continental
importations. These changes were not particularly pleasing to the
Conservative lady patronesses of Almack&rsquo;s, who were celebrated at
this time for their capricious exclusiveness. One of Robert Seymour&rsquo;s
satires, bearing date the 1st of November, 1830, shows us a
conference of these haughty dames, who seriously discuss the propriety
of admitting some lady (probably the queen) who proposed
appearing at one of the balls &ldquo;in some vulgar stuff made by the
<i>canaille</i> at a place called Kittlefields&rdquo; [Spitalfields].</p>

<p>Whilst England was thus peacefully passing through the excitement
<span class="sn">French Revolution of 1830.</span>
of a succession to a vacant throne, France was convulsed with
one of her ever-recurring revolutions. Charles the Tenth, driven
from his throne, had been replaced by one who in his turn, some
three and twenty years afterwards, was doomed to give place to the
Bonaparte whose sun we ourselves have seen set in the defeat and
disaster of Sedan. We find portraits in September, 1830, of Louis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>214</span>
Philippe, king of the French, of the queen, General Lafayette, the
ex-king Charles the Tenth, and the Duc d&rsquo;Angoulème. Besides
these, we meet with several clever illustrations by the artist, on
stone, of the stirring events of the time, which are interesting and
valuable specimens of his versatile powers.</p>

<p>Some of our readers may remember a passage in Peter Pindar,
where the merciless satirist ridicules George the Third&rsquo;s German
band, telling us (in allusion to his Majesty&rsquo;s well-known penurious
habits) that, although they displaced native talent and expected
&ldquo;to feast upon the Coldstream regiments fat,&rdquo; their experience was
altogether of another character:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>

<p class="i05">To feasts they went indeed, but went and starved!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The services of these foreign musical mercenaries had been
retained by George the Fourth, but one of the very earliest acts of
his successor was to dismiss them in favour of the guards&rsquo; bands,
&ldquo;who,&rdquo; however, if we are to believe Mr. Greville, had no great
reason to be thankful, but were on the contrary &ldquo;ready to die of it,&rdquo;
as they had to play every night without pay, and were moreover
&ldquo;prevented&rdquo; from earning money elsewhere. This act of the
new king is referred to in a sketch by Seymour, which shows us
his Majesty in the act of &ldquo;discharging the German band,&rdquo; who may
be seen marching off headed by their ancient and crestfallen drum-major.</p>

<p>The month of October, 1830, witnessed the trial of the notorious
<span class="sn">St. John Long.</span>
impostor, John St. John Long (whose real name was O&rsquo;Driscoll)
for the manslaughter of Miss Cushin. The success of this ignorant
and notorious quack, who managed for a series of years to extract
a magnificent income of some £10,000 or £12,000 per annum by
trading on the credulity of his fellow-creatures, forms a curious commentary
on the weakness of contemporary &ldquo;society.&rdquo; It is said
that he commenced life as a house-painter, and afterwards acquired
some slight knowledge of art in the humble capacity of colour
grinder to Sir Thomas Lawrence, and while colouring (on his own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>215</span>
account) some anatomical drawings for a medical London school,
picked up a slight and imperfect knowledge of anatomy. This
stimulated him to further superficial research; and after a few
months&rsquo; probation, his confidence enabled him to pretend that he
possessed a cure for every disease under the sun&mdash;more especially
consumption.<a name="FnAnchor_99" href="#Footnote_99"><span class="sp">99</span></a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Long&rsquo;s&rdquo; remedy (&ldquo;the prong&rdquo; referred to in the foregoing
ballad) was of the simplest possible character, and&mdash;his dupes in nine
cases out of ten being women&mdash;his success complete. He invented
a wonderful liniment or lotion, by means of which he professed to
diagnose and eradicate the virus of consumption. With many
patients an inflammation followed its application, which (according
to the quack) discovered the presence of disease, and which, after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>217</span>
a plentiful crop of guineas had been extracted, nature was allowed
to heal: the patient was then pronounced out of danger. With
some persons the liniment was perfectly innocuous, and when this
was the case the patient was informed that no disease need be
feared. The secret of course lay in the fact that the quack used
two liniments, apparently identical, one of which only contained the
irritating medium. Many actually consumptive persons of course
consulted him; but when this was the case he refused his assistance,
on the ground that it had been invoked too late.</p>

<p>He carried the imposition, as might have been anticipated, once
too far, and, in the case of the beautiful and unfortunate Miss Cushin
(a lady of highly nervous temperament), maintained the inflammation
for so long a time that nature for once refused to assist him,
and when Sir Benjamin Brodie was summoned, mortification had
already set in. The trial resulted in a verdict of guilty, but the
judge (Baron Parke), who summed up scandalously in his favour,
instead of sending the fellow to hard labour, imposed a fine of
£250, which was immediately paid.</p>

<p>Seymour alludes to this event in a pictorial satire, in which he
shows us St. John Long, with a vulture&rsquo;s head and beak, kneeling
on the floor of a dungeon with a bottle by his side labelled &ldquo;lotion,&rdquo;
and (beneath) the words,&mdash;&ldquo;Lost, £12,000 per annum, <i>medical
practice</i>. Whoever will restore the same to Mr. St. J. L&mdash;g, shall
receive the benefit of his advice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Cushin&rsquo;s death was quickly followed by another fatal case,
that of Mrs. Colin Campbell Lloyd, who also died from the effects
of the corrosive lotion, and St. John Long the following year was
again put on his trial for manslaughter; in this case the fellow was
acquitted. Seymour&rsquo;s prediction was not destined to be verified.
The <i>soi-disant</i> St. John Long, <i>alias</i> O&rsquo;Driscoll, in spite of these
&ldquo;mistakes,&rdquo; which in our day would receive a harsher term, retained

<p>The artist possibly had this quotation in his mind when he
designed the following:&mdash;The deponent is a country bumpkin, to
whom an official tenders the Testament, at the same time extending
his disengaged palm. &ldquo;Pleas zur,&rdquo; says Hodge, &ldquo;wot be I to zay?&rdquo;
(To him the officer), &ldquo;Say, This is the truth and nothing but the
truth, so help me God one and sixpence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The open and notorious bribery, corruption, and intimidation
which prevailed in those days at parliamentary elections; Sir Robert
Peel&rsquo;s &ldquo;New Police Act&rdquo; (which was received with extraordinary
suspicion and dislike); the Reform Bill; the universal distress and
consequent bread riots of 1830-31, form the subjects of other
pictorial satires by Robert Seymour, which seem, however, to call
for little notice.</p>

<p>The artist&rsquo;s talent and services were constantly in demand as a
designer on wood; but finding that the productions of his pencil
suffered at the hands of the wood-engravers to whom they were
entrusted, and the very inferior paper upon which the impressions
were taken, he, in or about the year 1827, began to learn the art of
etching on copper. We believe his earliest attempts in this direction
will be found in a work now exceedingly rare, bearing the title of
&ldquo;Assisting, Resisting, and Desisting.&rdquo; A volume called &ldquo;Vagaries,
in Quest of the Wild and Wonderful,&rdquo; which appeared in 1827, was
embellished with six clever plates after the manner of George
Cruikshank, and ran through no less than three editions.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Humorous Sketches,&rdquo; several times republished, perhaps
the only work by which Seymour is now known to the general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>219</span>
public, appeared between the years 1834 and 1836. They were
first published at threepence each by Richard Carlisle, of Fleet
Street, who is said to have paid the artist fifteen shillings for each
drawing on the stone. Carlisle falling into difficulties shortly before
Seymour&rsquo;s death, sold the copyright and lithographic stones to
Henry Wallis, who in turn parted with the latter to Mr. Tregear,
of Cheapside, but retaining his property in the copyright, transferred
the drawings to steel, and published them in 1838, with letterpress
by Alfred Crowquill. Mr. Henry G. Bohn issued an edition
in 1842, and another some twenty-three years later, with plates so
sadly worn and blurred by over use that the best part of this last
edition (issued by the Routledges in 1878) is the binding.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Humorous Sketches&rdquo; (we refer, of course, only to the
early impressions), although affording fair examples of the artist&rsquo;s
comic style and manner, are in truth of very unequal merit. They
comprise some eighty subjects, which, owing to the frequent republications,
are so well known that it would be superfluous to attempt a
detailed description of them here. The best is unquestionably the
one numbered XXV., &ldquo;This is a werry lonely spot, Sir; I wonder you
arn&rsquo;t afeard of being rob&rsquo;d.&rdquo; The inevitable sequel is amusingly
related by Crowquill:&mdash;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Sketches,&rdquo; with other detached works by the artist, reappeared
in an edition published by the late John Camden Hotten,
entitled &ldquo;Sketches by Seymour,&rdquo; comprising in all 186 subjects, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>220</span>
the most part sadly worn impressions. Although there is nothing
whatever &ldquo;Hogarthian&rdquo; about the originals, as the amiable publisher
would have us (as usual) believe, we may admit that the faces in
No. 24, <i>At a Concert</i>, are a perfect study, and that this sketch, with
Nos. 45 and 46 (<i>Snuffing</i> and <i>Smoking</i>), afford excellent examples of
the artist&rsquo;s ability as a draughtsman.</p>

<p>But the work which contains probably some of the best specimens
<span class="sn">&ldquo;The Book of Christmas.&rdquo;</span>
of the artist&rsquo;s style is one now exceedingly scarce. Christmas
books, like Christmas cards, are practically unsaleable after the great
Christian festival has come and gone; and this was the experience
of Mr. T. K. Hervey&rsquo;s &ldquo;Book of Christmas,&rdquo; which, owing to the
author&rsquo;s dilatoriness, came out &ldquo;a day after the fair,&rdquo; and despite
its attractions proved unmarketable. This circumstance, we need
not say, by no means detracts from its value, and as a matter
of fact, the collector will now deem himself fortunate if he succeeds
in securing a copy at a price exceeding by one half the original cost.
Those who have formed their ideas of Seymour&rsquo;s powers from the oft
republished and irretrievably damaged impressions of the &ldquo;Humorous
Sketches,&rdquo; will be astonished at the unaccustomed style, vigour, and
beauty of these illustrations. A few of the earlier <i>etchings</i> are somewhat
faint and indistinct, as if the artist, even at that time, was
scarcely accustomed to work on copper. They, however, improve as
he proceeds with his work; the larger number are really beautiful,
and are characterised by a vigour of conception and execution, of
which no possible idea can be formed by those who have seen only
the &ldquo;Humorous Sketches.&rdquo; Noteworthy among the illustrations
may be mentioned the finely executed head of <i>Old Christmas</i>, facing
page 23; the <i>Baronial Hall</i> (a picture highly realistic of the
Christmas comfort and good cheer which is little better than a myth
to many of us); <i>The Mummers</i>; <i>Christmas Pantomime</i>; <i>Market,
Christmas Eve</i>; <i>Boxing Day</i>; and <i>Twelfth Night in the London
Streets</i>. The cheery seasonable book shows us the <i>Norfolk Coach</i>
with its spanking team rattling into London on a foggy Christmas
Eve, heaped with fat turkeys, poultry, Christmas hampers and
parcels. William Congreve tells us&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">The irritable personage awoke from his slumbers by the music of
the waits, certainly does not belong to any of the order of animate
or inanimate subjects so softened, soothed, or bent, as aforesaid, for
he opens his window and prepares to discharge the contents of his
jug on the heads of the devoted minstrels. If the ancient ophicleide
player, with the brandy bottle protruding from his great coat
pocket, might but know of the impending cataract which more
immediately threatens himself, he would convey himself from the
dangerous neighbourhood with all the alacrity of which his spindle
shanks are capable. A younger neighbour on the opposite side of
the street awaits the catastrophe with amused interest, whilst a
drunken &ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo; executes&mdash;under the elevating influences of
music and drink&mdash;a <i>pas seul</i> on the pavement below. In the etching
of <i>Story Telling</i>, the deep shadows of an old baronial hall are
illuminated solely by the moonbeams and the flickering flame of
the firelight; a door opens into a gallery beyond, and one of the
listeners, fascinated by the ghost story to which she is listening,
glances fearfully over her shoulder as if apprehensive that something
uncanny will presently issue out of the black recesses. The ghostly
surroundings have their influences on the very cat, who looks uneasily
about her as if afraid of her shadow. Besides the thirty-six
etchings on copper, the book contains several charming woodcuts,
impressed on paper of a very different quality to that on which the
artist was accustomed to behold impressions from his wood blocks.</p>

<p>Of a class entirely different to the foregoing may be mentioned
the still rarer series of comicalities executed by the artist under the
title of &ldquo;New Readings of old Authors,&rdquo; of which we may notice
the following: <i>Moved in Good Time</i> (<i>Taming of the Shrew</i>, Act 2,
Sc. 1), a tax-gatherer and other creditors bemoaning themselves
outside the premises of a levanted debtor; <i>I am to get a man,
whate&rsquo;er he be</i> (Act 3, Sc. 2), disciples of Burke and Hare providing
themselves with a living subject; <i>I do remember when the fight was
done, when I was dry</i> (King Henry IV., Part 1, Act 1, Sc. 3), a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>222</span>
victorious prize-fighter recruiting his exhausted frame by imbibing
many quarts of strong ale; <i>He was much Feared by his Physicians</i>
(Act 4, Sc. 1), an irascible gouty patient flinging medicine bottles
and nostrums at one of his doctors, and stamping a prostrate one
under foot; <i>You are too great to be by me gainsaid</i> (<i>King Henry</i> IV.,
Part 2, Act 1, Sc. 1), a huge woman administering chastisement to a
small and probably (in more senses than one) <i>frail</i> husband; <i>My
Lord, I over rode him on the way</i> (Act 1, Sc. 1), a miserable huntsman
who has ridden over and killed one of the master&rsquo;s fox-hounds;
<i>He came, saw, and overcame</i> (Act 4, Sc. 2), a wretched Frenchman,
who, overbalancing himself, falls over the rails of a bear-pit amongst
the hungry animals below; <i>Never was such a sudden scholar made</i>,
(<i>King Henry</i> V., Act 1, Sc. 1), in allusion to the installation of the
Duke of Wellington as Chancellor of Oxford University; <i>A Midsummer
Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>, a fat sleeper suffering under the agonies of
nightmare, under the influence of whose delusion he fancies himself
roasting before a vast fire, with a huge hook stuck through his
stomach; and, <i>I beg the ancient privilege of Athens: as she is mine, I
may dispose of her</i> (Act 1, Sc. 1), an Englishman attempting to dispose
of his ugly, wooden-legged old harridan of a wife by auction.
The lithographic stones on which the drawings to these &ldquo;New Readings&rdquo;
were made, and which comprised no less than three hundred
drawings, were effaced before the artist&rsquo;s death, and impressions
from them are now, of course, more than difficult to procure. The
Shakespeare series were collected and republished in four volumes,
in 1841-2, by Tilt &amp; Bogue, of Fleet Street, and even these last are
very seldom met with.</p>

<p>On the 10th of December, 1831, there started into life a periodical
of decidedly pronounced political bias and opinions, entitled
&ldquo;Figaro in London.&rdquo; Politics ran high in those days; it was the time
of the great agitation for &ldquo;reform,&rdquo; which in those days, as we shall
presently see, was both loudly called for and imperatively necessary.
A mob of boys and degraded women had taken complete possession
of Bristol,&mdash;had driven its deformed little mayor over a stone wall
in ignominious flight,&mdash;had burnt down the gaol and the mansion-house,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>223</span>
and laid Queen Square in ashes, whilst the military and its
very strangely incompetent officer looked on while the city was burning.<a name="FnAnchor_103" href="#Footnote_103"><span class="sp">103</span></a>
Every one in those days was either a rabid Tory or an ultra
Radical. It was just the period for an enthusiastic youth to plunge
into the excitement of political life; but the crude, unformed
opinions of a young man scarcely of age are of little value, and the
political creed of the proprietor and originator of this literary (?)
venture does not appear to have been clearly defined even to himself.
In his valedictory addresses written three years afterwards, when
things were not altogether so rosy with him as when he started his
periodical, he confesses that he belongs to no party, for &ldquo;we have
had,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;such a thorough sickener of the Whigs, that we do
expect something better from the new government, <i>although it be a
Tory one</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The price of &ldquo;Figaro in London,&rdquo; one of the immediate predecessors
of the comic publications of our day, was a penny, quite an
experiment in times when the price of paper was dear, and periodical
literature was heavily handicapped with an absurdly heavy duty.
&ldquo;Figaro&rdquo; consisted of four weekly pages of letterpress illustrated by
Robert Seymour. The projector, proprietor, and editor, was Mr.
Gilbert à Beckett, whose name&mdash;with those of men of vastly superior
literary attainments&mdash;was associated in after years with the early fortunes
of <i>Punch</i>. The literary part of the performance was indeed sorry
stuff,&mdash;the main stay and prop of the paper from its very commencement
was Seymour, whose drawings however suffered severely at
the hands of the engraver and paper maker. An eccentricity of
the publication perhaps deserves notice. It professed to look with
sovereign contempt upon advertisements, as occupying a quantity of
unnecessary space&mdash;considering, however, that exception was made
in favour of one particularly persevering hatter of the period, we are
driven to the conclusion that the projector&rsquo;s contempt for a source
of revenue which modern newspaper proprietors can by no means
afford to despise, was nearly akin to that expressed by the fox after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>224</span>
he had come to the melancholy conclusion that the grapes he longed
for were absolutely beyond his reach.</p>

<p>The new periodical assumed from the outset a position which
cannot fail to amuse the journalist and reader of the present day. It
professed to look down upon all other publications (with certain
exceptions of magnitude, whom the editor deemed it prudent to
conciliate) with supercilious contempt. The absurdity of these pretensions
will strike any one who turns over its forgotten pages, and
compares his pretensions with Mr. à Beckett&rsquo;s own share of the
performance. The mode in which this young gentleman&rsquo;s editorial
duties were conducted, gathered from extracts taken at random from
the &ldquo;Notices to Correspondents,&rdquo; were, to say the least, peculiar:
&ldquo;A. B., who has written to us, is a fool of the very lowest order. His
communication is rejected.&rdquo; Poor Mr. Cox of Bath is told he &ldquo;is a
rogue and a fool for sending us a letter without paying the postage.
If he wants his title page, let him order it of his bookseller, when it
will be got as a matter of course from our publisher,&rdquo; and so on.
The aristocracy are regarded with a disfavour which must have given
them serious disquietude. The &ldquo;coming out&rdquo; of the daughter of
the late Lord Byron, or a <i>soirée</i> at the Duchess of Northumberland&rsquo;s
town house, serve as occasions for indulging in splenetic abuse of
what Mr. à Beckett was pleased to term &ldquo;the beastly aristocracy.&rdquo;
Authors, even of position, were not spared by this young Ishmael of
the press, the respected Mrs. Trollope, for instance, being unceremoniously
referred to as &ldquo;Mother Trollope.&rdquo; The only excuse of
course for this sort of thing is to be found in the fact that comic
journalism being then in its infancy, personal abuse was mistaken for
satire; while, so far as the bad taste of the editor is concerned,
allowance must be made for an inexperienced young man who
imagined that the editorship of a paper, wholly destitute of merit
except that which Seymour brought to its aid, conferred upon himself
a position which rendered him superior to the rules of literary
courtesy.</p>

<p>With all these pretensions, however, à Beckett was conscious of
the powerful assistance he was receiving from the artist; and we find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>225</span>
him, after his own peculiar fashion and more than questionable taste,
constantly alluding to the fact; describing him at various times as
&ldquo;that highly gifted and popular artist, Mr. Seymour;&rdquo; &ldquo;our illustrious
artist Seymour;&rdquo; and so on. In the preface to his second
volume, he indulges in the following flight of fancy, which will
suffice to give us an idea of the literary merits of the editor himself:
&ldquo;In this our annual address,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;we cannot omit a puff for
the rampant Seymour, in whom the public continue to <i>see-more</i> and
more every time he puts his pencil to the block for the illustration of
our periodical.&rdquo; This was the sort of stuff which passed for wit in
1832.<a name="FnAnchor_104" href="#Footnote_104"><span class="sp">104</span></a> As for Seymour himself, he was annoyed at these fulsome
and foolish compliments, and in a letter which he wrote to À Beckett
after the quarrel to be presently related, told him in the plainest
terms that, &ldquo;the engraving, bad printing, and extravagant puffing of
his designs were calculated to do him more harm than good as an
artist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But artist and editor jogged on together in perfect good will until
the 16th of August, 1834, when, for the first and only time, &ldquo;Figaro
in London&rdquo; made its appearance without any illustrations at all. The
two succeeding weekly issues contained each a single woodcut after
Seymour&rsquo;s drawing, but from that time until the end of the year,
when À Beckett himself retired from the proprietorship and disposed
of his interest in the concern, the paper was illustrated by Isaac
Robert Cruikshank; this change was due to the following circumstance.</p>

<p>A special feature of &ldquo;Figaro in London&rdquo; was its theatrical leader.
À Beckett had always taken an interest in dramatic matters, and was
himself author of some thirty plays, the very titles of which are now
forgotten. Not content with being proprietor and editor of a newspaper,
he was concerned at this time in another venture, being proprietor
and manager of a theatre in Tottenham Court Road, known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>226</span>
at different times under the various designations of the Tottenham
Street or West London Theatre, the Queen&rsquo;s, and latterly as the
Prince of Wales&rsquo; Theatre. The result was almost a foregone conclusion.
A newspaper is a sufficiently hazardous speculation, but a
theatre in the hands of an inexperienced manager is one of the most
risky of all possible experiments; and the result in this case was so
unfortunate, that À Beckett in the end had to seek the uncomfortable
protection of the insolvent court. He was considerably
indebted to Seymour for the illustrations to &ldquo;Figaro,&rdquo; half of the
debt thus incurred being money actually paid away by the artist to
the engraver who executed the cuts from his drawings on the wood.
Finding that À Beckett was in no position to discharge this debt or
to remunerate him for his future services, Seymour did&mdash;what every
man of business must have done who, like the artist, was dependent
on his pencil for <i>bread</i>, refused any longer to continue his assistance.
Apart from the bad paper and bad impressions of which he
complained, and above all the bad taste displayed in fulsome adulation
of his own merits, supremely distasteful to a man of real ability,
Seymour appears hitherto to have entertained no bad feeling
towards À Beckett personally.</p>

<p>The result however was a feud. À Beckett was not unnaturally
angry, and an angry man in his passion is apt to lose both his head
and his memory. Forgetting the manner in which he had shortly
before acknowledged the services and talent of the artist, he now
attacked him and his abilities with a malice which would be unintelligible
if we had not seen something of his nature and disposition.
In his favourite &ldquo;Notices to Correspondents&rdquo; in the number
of 13th September, 1834, he professes to account for the employment
of Isaac Robert Cruikshank after the following disingenuous
fashion: &ldquo;Mr. Seymour, our ex-artist, is much to be pitied for his
extreme anguish at our having come to terms with the celebrated
Robert Cruikshank in the supplying the designs of the caricatures
in &lsquo;Figaro.&rsquo; Seymour has been venting his rage in a manner as
pointless as it is splenetic, and we are sorry for him. He ought,
however, to feel, that notwithstanding our friendly wish to bring him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>227</span>
forward, which we have done in an eminent degree, we must engage
<i>first-rate</i> ability when public patronage is bestowed so liberally, as it
now is upon this periodical. He ought therefore not to be nettled
at our having obtained a superior artist.&rdquo; The public, however, were
not to be <i>gulled</i>; they perfectly well knew that Isaac Robert Cruikshank
was an inferior artist in every respect to Seymour, and had
not forgotten the tribute which the foolish editor had previously
paid to the talents and ability of the latter. Conduct like this could
only recoil on the head of the person who was injudicious and
spiteful enough to be guilty of it. The &ldquo;Notices to Correspondents&rdquo;
in subsequent numbers continued to be filled with references and
allusions to Seymour, dictated by a malice which was alike silly and
childish. They are not worthy of repetition here, and we must refer
the reader for them to the numbers of &ldquo;Figaro in London&rdquo; of 20th
September and 15th November, 1834, or (if he have not access to
its pages) to the short biographical notice prefixed to the latest
edition of the &ldquo;Sketches&rdquo; by Mr. Henry G. Bohn. We have no
doubt whatever that the interval between these dates was employed
in fruitless endeavours on the part of À Beckett to arrange terms
with the artist, who, however, steadily refused to give the failing
publication the indispensable benefit of his assistance. Left as it
were to its own resources, the circulation, in spite of the graphic help
accorded by Robert Cruikshank, steadily declined, and À Beckett
finally retired from the editorship and proprietorship on the 27th of
December, 1834. Seymour wielded a far more effectual weapon of
offence than any which À Beckett possessed, and dealt him blows
which at this time and in his then circumstances must have been
keenly felt. One of Seymour&rsquo;s satires is aimed specially at the
&ldquo;Notices to Correspondents&rdquo; already mentioned, and shows us a
heavy, vulgar fellow seated at his desk, habited in a barber&rsquo;s striped
dressing-gown <i>à la Figaro</i>. His features are distorted with passion,
for he has received a letter the contents of which are anything but
flattering, addressed &ldquo;To the Editor of the nastiest thing in London.&rdquo;
This sketch bears the following descriptive title: &ldquo;An
editor in a <i>small way</i>, after pretending a great deal about his correspondents,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>228</span>
is here supposed to have received <i>a</i> letter.&rdquo; A second
skit shows us a critic examining a picture representing &ldquo;the death
of À Beckett, Archbishop of Cant.&rdquo; A figure in armour, with its
vizor down (obviously intended for the artist) is depicted in the act
of cutting at the &ldquo;archbishop&rdquo; with a sword, the blade of which
is inscribed &ldquo;debts due.&rdquo; His first blow has severed the mitre
labelled &ldquo;assumption,&rdquo; and the pastoral staff, inscribed &ldquo;impudence,&rdquo;
with which the victim vainly endeavours to defend himself. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
says À Beckett, as he falls prostrate amid a heap of &ldquo;spoilt paper,&rdquo;
among which we recognise, &ldquo;Figaro,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Thief,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Wag,&rdquo;
and other periodicals with which his name was associated. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
cut at me &lsquo;our own inimitable, our illustrious, our talented;&rsquo; pray
don&rsquo;t give me any more cuts; think how many I have had and not
paid you for already:&rdquo; a hand indicates the way &ldquo;to the Insolvent
Court.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Figaro,&rdquo; after the retirement of À Beckett, passed into the
editorial hands of Mr. H. Mayhew, and conscious of the injury
which the defection of Seymour had done to the undertaking, he
lost no time in opening negotiations with a view to his return. In
this he experienced little difficulty, for Seymour was glad to avail
himself of the opportunity of giving to the public the most convincing
proof which could have been adduced of the falsity of the
libels which had been published by the retiring and discomfited
editor. The fourth volume commenced 3rd of January, and from
that time until his death (in 1836) he continued to illustrate the
paper. Mayhew announces his return after the following curious
fashion: &ldquo;The generous Seymour, with a patriotic ardour unequalled
since the days of Curtius, has abandoned all selfish considerations,
and yielded to our request for his country&rsquo;s sake. Again he wields
the satiric pencil, and corruption trembles to its very base. His
first peace-offering to &lsquo;Figaro in London,&rsquo; is the rich etching
[woodcut] our readers now gaze upon with laughing eyes.&rdquo; Constant
references of a laudatory kind are made to him in succeeding
numbers.</p>

<p>The woodcuts after Seymour&rsquo;s designs, which appear in &ldquo;Figaro
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>229</span>
in London,&rdquo; are too small and unimportant to justify the title which
the editor gives them of &ldquo;caricatures;&rdquo; and relating to political
matters which at that time were far more efficiently chronicled by
the pencil of H. B., they have lost any interest which they once
might have commanded. The most interesting illustrations which
Seymour contributed to &ldquo;Figaro,&rdquo; are the brief series of theatrical
portraits, which are not only clever but evidently excellent likenesses.</p>

<p>It was not only in the case of &ldquo;Figaro in London&rdquo; that the
slanders of À Beckett recoiled upon his own head. That gentleman
in 1832 had started a sort of rival to Hood&rsquo;s &ldquo;Comic Annual,&rdquo;
under the title of the &ldquo;Comic Magazine.&rdquo; It was cheaper in price
than the former publication, and contained an amazing number of
amusing cuts of the punning order, after Seymour&rsquo;s designs. After
the quarrel with À Beckett, the artist withdrew his assistance from
its pages, and the illustrations show a fearful falling off after 1833.
Many of the wretched designs which follow bear the signature of
&ldquo;Dank,&rdquo; and so destitute are they of merit that the &ldquo;embellishments&rdquo;
(as they are termed) for 1834, are altogether below criticism.</p>

<p>At the opening of the present chapter we said that Robert
Seymour was <i>almost</i> a genius. Genius, however, he never absolutely
touched; he was destitute of the inventive faculties which distinguished
John Leech, and lacked the vivid imagination which
enabled George Cruikshank to realize any idea which occurred to
him, whether comical, grave, realistic, or terrible. His talents as an
artist, though undoubtedly great, ran in a narrow groove, and their
bent is shown by the well-known &ldquo;Humorous Sketches,&rdquo; and the
less known but far more admirable designs which he executed for
the &ldquo;Comic Magazine.&rdquo; He always had a fancy for depicting and
satirizing cockneys and cockney subjects, and had conceived the by
no means new or ambitious idea of producing a series of such
pictures with an appropriate letterpress to be furnished by a literary
coadjutor, whose work, however, was to be subservient to his own.
The idea was not perhaps a very definite one, but the pictorial part
of the work was commenced, and four plates actually etched at the
time the artist was retained to execute the illustrations to the &ldquo;Book
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>230</span>
of Christmas.&rdquo; Out of this undeveloped idea, and out of the four
apparently unimportant drawings to which we have alluded, was
destined to evolve the strange and melancholy story which will
be associated for all time with the mirth-inspiring novel of the
&ldquo;Pickwick Papers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The difficulty at the outset was to find an author to carry out the
<span class="sn">Origin of &ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo;</span>
artist&rsquo;s idea, indefinite as it was. In this direction there was in 1836,
a very <i>embarras de richesses</i>, for, if comic artists were few, there was
on the other hand no lack of humourists of the highest order of
merit. Theodore Hook, Clark (the author of &ldquo;Three Courses and
a Dessert&rdquo;)&mdash;probably many others were suggested by the publishers
who were taken into consultation by Seymour; but all were rejected.
He himself seems to have inclined towards Mayhew, with whom it
will be recollected he was associated at this time on &ldquo;Figaro in
London.&rdquo; The man of all others most fitted to carry out the artist&rsquo;s
<i>own</i> idea seems to us to have been John Poole, one of the most
original of English humourists, whose productions, now forgotten,
are worth searching for in the pages of the &ldquo;New Monthly&rdquo; and
other periodical publications of a past day. It is a singular fact, too,
that on the first appearance of the &ldquo;Pickwick Papers,&rdquo; the authorship
was by many ascribed to this very man. In the end, Mr.
Chapman, of the firm of Chapman &amp; Hall, introduced the artist
to one of the most unlikely men for his own purpose that could
possibly have been selected,&mdash;the man, as we have already seen,
of all others the least fitted and the least disposed to act the part of
William Coombe to Seymour&rsquo;s character of Thomas Rowlandson.</p>

<p>At this time Charles Dickens was reporter on the staff of a
newspaper; he had written a book which, although successful, had
created no very intense excitement; he was moreover a young man,
and consequently plastic, and fifteen pounds a month would be a small
fortune to him; so at least argued the artist and his friends. How
little they understood the resolute, self-reliant character of this
unknown writer! The result was altogether different from anything
they expected. Author and artist differed at the outset as to the
form the narrative should take; but the man with the strongest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>231</span>
power of mind and will took his stand from the first, and Charles
Dickens made it a condition of his retainer that the illustrations
should grow out of the text, instead of the latter being suggested
(as Seymour desired) by the illustrations, and the artist had reluctantly
to give way. No one can doubt that the author was right.
By way however of a concession, and of meeting Seymour&rsquo;s original
idea as far as practicable, he introduced the absurd character of
Winkle, the cockney sportsman. The mode of publication followed
was the artist&rsquo;s own suggestion, who, desiring the widest possible
circulation, insisted on the work being published in monthly numbers
at a shilling. Thus it was that &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; came to be written.</p>

<p>We are not called on in this place to discuss the merits of
&ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo;; to compare Charles Dickens with the writers who had
immediately preceded him; to enlarge upon the comic vein which
he discovered and made so peculiarly his own; to show the influence
which his humour exercised upon the literature of the next
quarter of a century; to contrast such humour with his wonderful
power of pathos; to marshal the shades of true-hearted, noble Nell,
unhappy Smike, little Paul Dombey, world abandoned Joe, and compare
them with the Wellers&mdash;father and son, Mr. Jingle, Tracy Tupman,
Bob Sawyer, and the spectacled but essentially owlish founder of
the &ldquo;Pickwick Club.&rdquo; All this we fancy has been done in another
place; our task is altogether of a simpler character. We have to
trace the connection which subsisted between the artist and author;
to show how this book&mdash;the creation of a writer in the spring-time
of his genius&mdash;the essence of fun, the unfailing source of merriment
to countless readers past, present, and to come, came to be associated
with the memory of a terrible and still incomprehensible tragedy.</p>

<p>We have seen that, contrary to his own wishes, Seymour had
yielded to Charles Dickens&rsquo; suggestion, or rather condition, that the
illustrations should grow out of the text; but he does not seem to
have abandoned (so far as we can judge) all idea of having a hand
in the management of the story, and he never for one instant contemplated
interference on the part of the author with any one of his
own designs. If we are to believe his friends (and their testimony
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>232</span>
seems to us distinctly valuable in this place), he was extremely
angry at the introduction into the plot of the &ldquo;Stroller&rsquo;s Tale,&rdquo; and
we may therefore fancy the spirit in which he would receive Charles
Dickens&rsquo; intimation, conveyed to him in the same manner that he
afterwards communicated to Cruikshank his disapproval of the last
etching in &ldquo;Oliver Twist,&rdquo; that he objected to that etching &ldquo;as not
quite <i>his</i> [Dickens&rsquo;] idea;&rdquo; that he wished &ldquo;to have it as complete
as possible, and would feel personally obliged if he would make
another drawing.&rdquo; The letter (on the whole a kindly one) has been
set out elsewhere,<a name="FnAnchor_105" href="#Footnote_105"><span class="sp">105</span></a> and there is no occasion to repeat it here.
What other causes of irritation existed will never be known. All
that is still known is, that he executed a fresh design and handed
it over to Dickens at the time appointed; that he went home and
destroyed nearly all the correspondence relating to the subject of
&ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo;; that he executed a drawing for a wood-engraver
named John Jackson,<a name="FnAnchor_106" href="#Footnote_106"><span class="sp">106</span></a> and delivered it himself on the evening of
the 20th of April, 1836; that he then returned to his house in King
Street, Islington, and committed self-destruction. He left behind
him an unfinished drawing for &ldquo;Figaro in London,&rdquo; which afterwards
appeared (in the state in which it was found) in the pages
of that periodical.</p>

<p>Various reasons have been assigned for this rash act, all more or
less contradictory. According to some he was a man of equable
temperament; while others, who knew him personally, have told us
that he was nervous and subject to terrible fits of depression. Some
would trace the act to his quarrel with À Beckett; but this is simply
absurd, seeing that it had occurred some two years before. We
need not, as it seems to us, travel out of our course to seek the real
cause, which was probably due to over-work. His energies had
been tasked to the utmost to keep pace with the supply which his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>233</span>
ever-increasing popularity brought him. The state of his mind
appears to us clearly indicated by his design of <i>The Dying Clown</i>,
one of the last drawings which he etched for the &ldquo;Pickwick
Papers,&rdquo; and for which we must refer the reader to the <i>original</i>
edition only; anything more truly melancholy we can scarcely
imagine. Entirely appropriate to the story, it seems to tell its
own tale of the morbid state of mind of the man who designed it;
it is a pictorial commentary on the sad story we have attempted
to tell.</p>

<p>A too zealous application to work has destroyed many men both
of talent and genius; it produces different effects in different individuals,
according to their respective temperaments: while it drove

<p>The coadjutorship of distinguished artists and authors has led to
more than one strange controversy. Those who have read Forster&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Life of Dickens&rdquo; will remember the curious claim which George
Cruikshank preferred after Dickens&rsquo; death to be the suggester
of the story of &ldquo;Oliver Twist,&rdquo; and the unceremonious mode in
which Mr. Forster disposed of that pretension. We have referred
elsewhere to the edifying controversy between George Cruikshank
and Harrison Ainsworth, in relation to the origin of the latter&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>234</span>
novels of the &ldquo;Miser&rsquo;s Daughter&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Tower of London.&rdquo;
The republication of Seymour&rsquo;s &ldquo;Humorous Sketches&rdquo; in 1866,
led to a very curious claim on the part of his friends, in which they
sought to establish the fact that he was the originator and inventor
of the incidents of &ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo; This claim happily was made
while Dickens was yet alive, and was very promptly and satisfactorily
disposed of by himself in a letter which he wrote to the
<i>Athenæum</i> on the 20th of March, 1866. Author and artist have
long since gone to their rest; and the plan which the author of this
work proposed when he sat down to write the story of Robert
Seymour, was to place that artist in the position which he believes
him to occupy in the ranks of British graphic humourists, and not
to rake up or revive the memory of a somewhat painful controversy.
Of the claim itself we would simply remark, that not only was it
made in all sincerity by those who loved and cherished the memory
of Robert Seymour, but that to a certain extent the claim has a
foundation of fact to rest upon; for who will deny that had not
Seymour communicated his idea to Chapman, and Chapman introduced
the artist to Dickens, the &ldquo;Pickwick Papers&rdquo; themselves
would have remained unwritten. In this sense, but in this sense
only, therefore, Robert Seymour was the undoubted originator of
&ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo; He was an artist of great power, talent, and ability;
and it seems to us that those only detract from his fame who, in
a kind but mistaken spirit of zeal, would claim for him any other
position than that which he so justly and honestly earned for himself,
as one of the most talented of English graphic satirists.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<h5><i>THE POLITICAL SKETCHES OF</i> <span class="cn">HB</span>.</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> years 1830-32 were full of political trouble; men&rsquo;s minds
were unsettled; progress was the order of the day, and a reform
in the election of the members who represented or who were
supposed to represent the political opinions of the English constituencies
was not only loudly called for, but had (as we have
seen) for a very long time past been imperatively demanded. The
question was shelved from time to time, but sooner or later it
must be settled, and as Liberals and Conservatives alike will be
amused and astounded at the state of English parliamentary
representation half a century ago, we propose just to glance at
matters as they existed in 1830.</p>

<p>The Marquis of Blandford was a somewhat notable character
in those days. He had been a violent opponent of the Catholic
Relief Bill; but from the moment that measure was carried had
become as fiery and reckless a reformer.<a name="FnAnchor_108" href="#Footnote_108"><span class="sp">108</span></a> On the 18th of February,
1830, he proposed that a committee should be chosen by ballot
to take a review of all boroughs and cities in the kingdom, and
report to the Secretary of State for the Home Department those
among them which had fallen into decay, or had in any manner
forfeited their right to representation on the principles of the
English constitution as anciently recognised by national and parliamentary
usage. The Home Secretary was to be bound immediately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>236</span>
to act on this report, and to relieve all such places from
the burthen of sending members to parliament in future, and the
vacancies were to be supplied by towns which had hitherto been
unrepresented. All parliamentary representatives were to be
elected by persons &ldquo;paying scot and lot.&rdquo; He further proposed
to extend the right of voting to all copyholders and leaseholders,
and to place the representation of Scotland on an equal footing
with that of England. The members were to be chosen from the
inhabitants of the places for which they were returned, and were
to be paid for their services according as they were borough or
county members. The former were to receive two guineas a day
each, and county members four guineas; why the latter were to
be estimated at double the value of the former does not seem
clear. Mr. Brougham, although ready to vote for this somewhat
extraordinary measure, &ldquo;because much of what it proposed to do
was good,&rdquo; recommended that a merely general resolution that
reform was necessary should be substituted in its place. Lord
Althorp moved an amendment accordingly on the terms suggested;
but both the amendment and the original motion were negatived.</p>

<p>On the third reading of what was then known as the &ldquo;East
Retford&rdquo; bill, the first attempt was made in parliament by
O&rsquo;Connell to introduce a new principle into the representative
system of the country, viz., that the votes of the electors should
be taken by ballot. Only twenty-one members voted for
O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s motion, among whom the names now most familiar
to us are those of Lord Althorp, Sir Francis Burdett, and Mr.
Hume.</p>

<p>The most ultra-Conservative, however, of our day, who thinks
that the representation of the people has already been carried
far enough, will scarcely credit the fact, that in those days constituencies
such as Leeds, Manchester, and Birmingham were
absolutely unrepresented. Yet such was the case. The motion
for transferring the franchise of East Retford to Birmingham
having been lost, Lord John Russell, on the 23rd of February,
brought the matter of the great unrepresented constituencies before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>237</span>
parliament by moving for leave to bring in a bill &ldquo;to enable Leeds,
Manchester, and Birmingham to return members to the House
of Commons.&rdquo; It seems scarcely credible to us now-a-days, that
this reasonable motion was <i>negatived</i> by 188 to 140.</p>

<p>On the 28th of May, O&rsquo;Connell brought in a wilder scheme.
He moved for leave to bring in a bill to establish triennial parliaments,
universal suffrage, and vote by ballot; the simple foundation
of his system being that every man who pays a tax or is liable
to serve in the militia is entitled to have a voice in the representation
of the country. Only thirteen members were found to
join him in a house of 332. Lord John Russell, who took
advantage of this motion to introduce certain resolutions of his
own, embracing a wider scheme of reform than that included in
his former programme, could not consent to any part of O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s
scheme. Dismissing the subject of triennial parliaments as a
subject of comparative unimportance, and passing on to the other
propositions, universal suffrage and vote by ballot, he contended
that both were incompatible with the principles of the English
Constitution. Mr. Brougham, while he thought that the duration
of parliaments might be shortened with considerable advantage,
provided that other measures for removing improper influence
were adopted, declared himself both against universal suffrage and
against vote by ballot; and he entered into a full statement of
the grounds on which he held that the secresy of voting supposed
to be attained by the ballot would produce most mischievous
consequences without securing the object which it professed to
have in view. The resolutions moved by Lord John Russell
(after O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s motion had been negatived) were as follows:
(1) &ldquo;That it was expedient the number of representatives in the
House should be increased;&rdquo; (2) &ldquo;That it was expedient to give
members to the large and manufacturing towns, and additional
members to counties of great wealth and population.&rdquo; Under
the second of the resolutions, it was proposed to divide large and
populous counties, such as Yorkshire for instance, into two divisions,
and to give to each of them two members. Among the towns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>238</span>
proposed to be benefited were such important centres as Macclesfield,
Stockport, Cheltenham, Birmingham, Brighton, Whitehaven,
Wolverhampton, Sunderland, Manchester, Bury, Bolton, Dudley,
Leeds, Halifax, Sheffield, North and South Shields; while it was
stated that the same principle would apply to extend the representation
to cities of such importance as Edinburgh, Glasgow,
and Belfast. All the resolutions, however (comprising a third
which we have considered it unnecessary to refer to), were negatived
by the amazing majority of 213 to 117. The fact that this was
a much larger majority than that which had thrown out the
previous and more limited proposal for extending the franchise
to three only of the manufacturing towns, will suffice to show
the spirit in which the unreformed parliament of 1830 was accustomed
to receive any suggestion of improvement and reform,
reasonable or otherwise.</p>

<p>It may perhaps seem strange that at this stirring period there
was an absolute dearth of political caricaturists, but the fact we
have already attempted to account for. George Cruikshank, the
finest caricaturist of his day, as well as his brother Robert, neither
of whom can be described as purely political satirists, had now
practically retired from the practice of the art, and were employed
on work of a totally different character. Political caricature
languished; indeed, if we perhaps except William Heath, oftentimes
better known by his artistic pseudonym of &ldquo;Paul Pry,&rdquo;
there was not a political caricaturist of any note in 1829-30.</p>

<p>At this juncture there arose a graphic satirist&mdash;if indeed we
are justified in so terming him&mdash;of genuine originality. Before
1829, he had been known only as a miniature painter of some
celebrity; but he possessed a taste for satiric art, and had essayed
several subjects of political character which he treated in a style
and manner differing altogether from the mode in which satirical
pictures had hitherto been treated. These he showed to Maclean,
one of the great caricature publishers of the day, who had sufficient
discernment and prescience to recognise in them the work
of a man of unquestionable original ability. He prevailed on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>239</span>
the artist to publish these specimens, and their success was so
genuine and unmistakable that both publisher and artist decided
to continue them. Thus commenced a series of political pictures
which ultimately numbered almost a thousand, and ran an uninterrupted
course of prosperity for a period of upwards of two and
twenty years.</p>

<p>The enormous success and reputation which the &ldquo;sketches,&rdquo; as
they were called, achieved, was due not only to the cleverness and
originality of the artist himself, but also in a great measure to the
mystery which attended their publication and appearance. Both
parties concerned in their production preserved an inviolable secrecy
on the subject of the identity of the artist and the place whence
the &ldquo;sketches&rdquo; originated. Mr. Buss tells us,<a name="FnAnchor_109" href="#Footnote_109"><span class="sp">109</span></a> &ldquo;the drawings were
called for in a mysterious hackney coach, mysteriously deposited in
a mysterious lithographic printing office, and as mysteriously printed
and mysteriously stored until the right day of publication.&rdquo; The
<span class="cn">HB</span> mystery was most religiously preserved for a great number of
years, both by the artist and the publisher. The initials afforded
no clue to those not immediately concerned in preserving the
secret; and yet in this very original monogram lay the key to the
whole of the mystery. The origin of this signature was simply the
junction of two I&rsquo;s and two D&rsquo;s (one above the other), thus converting
the double initials into <span class="cn">HB</span>. The single initials were those
of John Doyle, father of the late Richard Doyle, who afterwards
made his own mark as a comic artist in the pages of <i>Punch</i> and
elsewhere.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;sketches&rdquo; of <span class="cn">HB</span> were a complete innovation upon pictorial
satire. The idea of satirizing political subjects and public men
without the exaggeration or vulgarity which the caricaturists had
more or less inherited from Gillray, was entirely new to the public,
and took with them immensely; and herein lies their peculiarity,
that whilst the subjects are treated with a distinctly sarcastic
humour, there is an absence of anything approaching to exaggeration,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>240</span>
and the likenesses of the persons represented are most faithfully
preserved. Whilst claiming for himself the character of a pictorial
satirist, the artist is all throughout anxious to impress upon you the
fact that he repudiates the notion of being considered a caricaturist
in the Johnsonian meaning of the word. This <i>idea</i> seems also to
have struck Thackeray, who, writing at the time when the sketches
were appearing, says of him, &ldquo;You never hear any laughing at
&rsquo;H.B.&rsquo;; his pictures are a great deal too genteel for that,&mdash;polite
points of wit, which strike one as exceedingly clever and pretty, and
cause one to smile in a quiet, gentlemanlike kind of way.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_110" href="#Footnote_110"><span class="sp">110</span></a>
Throughout the series of sketches we know but of one instance
where the artist suffers any comparison to be established between
himself and the political caricaturists who had preceded him, and
that is the one entitled <i>Bombardment Extraordinary</i> (having reference
to the indictment for libel against the <i>Morning Journal</i>, which
was shortly followed by the collapse of that paper), which is treated
to the full as coarsely as Gillray himself might desire. The fact
of this being among the earliest sketches would seem to show that
the artist had not then quite made up his mind whether to follow
in the footsteps of his great predecessor or not. We think the
result must have convinced him that, whilst having distinct merits
of his own as a satirist, and indeed as an artist, he was very far
behind Gillray; and the rest of the sketches seem to show that
their designer had made up his mind that no middle course was
possible;&mdash;in other words, that he must be <span class="cn">HB</span> or nothing.</p>

<p>The faithfulness of the likenesses of the persons who appear in
these &ldquo;sketches&rdquo; is simply marvellous. Not only has the artist
preserved the features of the subjects of his satires, but he has
caught their attitude&mdash;their manner, almost their tricks and habits,&mdash;and
the drawings being, as we have said, wholly free from
exaggeration, the very men stand before you, often, it is true, in
absurd and ridiculous positions. The persons who figure in these
lithographs comprise among names of note many whose reputations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>241</span>
were too ephemeral to preserve them from oblivion. On the other
hand, amongst the various groups we recognise Prince Talleyrand,
the Dukes of Cumberland, Gloucester, Wellington, and Sussex,
George the Fourth, William the Fourth, Louis Philippe, her present
Majesty, Lord Brougham, Colonel Sibthorpe, Count Pozzo di Borgo,
Daniel O&rsquo;Connell, Lord John Russell, Sir Robert Peel, Mr. Hume,
Lord Melbourne, Lord Palmerston, Sir Francis Burdett, Mr.
Roebuck, Sir James Graham. Persons with no political reputation
or connection are occasionally introduced to serve the purposes of
the artist: doing duty for him in this manner we find the Rev.
Edward Irving; Townsend the &ldquo;runner,&rdquo; of Bow Street notoriety;
George Robins, the auctioneer; Liston, the comedian; and others.</p>

<p>Ever on the alert for comic subjects, John Doyle was remarkably
prompt and ready to catch an idea. Frequently these ideas were
suggested to him by a phrase&mdash;a sentence&mdash;a few words in a speech;
occasionally he takes a hint from his Lempriére; whilst not unfrequently
his happiest conceptions are derived from a character or
scene in one of the popular operas or farces of the time. Thus,
in one of the debates on the Reform Bill in the House of Lords,
some very high words passed between Lords Grey and Kenyon, the
latter applying the words &ldquo;abandoned&rdquo; and &ldquo;atrocious&rdquo; to the
conduct of the former, who on his part declared in reply that he
threw back the expressions with scorn and indignation. In the
midst of the confusion the Duke of Cumberland rose, and implored
their lordships to tranquillize themselves and proceed with the
debate in a temperate and orderly manner, advice which, after
taking time to cool, they thought it prudent to follow. The farce
of &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Be Your Second&rdquo; was then running at the Olympic, Mr.
Liston taking the part of &ldquo;Placid,&rdquo; who, having a pecuniary interest
in one of the characters who has a weakness for duelling, is kept
in a state of nervous anxiety, and constantly interposes with the
question, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t this affair be arranged?&rdquo; In one of his &ldquo;sketches,&rdquo;
<span class="cn">HB</span> gives us <i>A Scene from the Farce of &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Be Your Second,&rdquo;</i> in
which the Duke of Cumberland is represented as Placid, endeavouring
to arrange matters amicably between my Lords Kenyon and Grey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>242</span></p>

<p>The duke himself was one of the most unpopular personages of
<span class="sn">Duke of Cumberland.</span>
his time, and evinced on his part a contempt for public opinion
which did nothing to lessen the prejudice with which he was
generally regarded. We dislike a man none the less for knowing
that he is conscious of and indifferent to our good or bad opinion;
and so it was with the Duke of Cumberland. He followed his
pleasure (field sports amongst the rest) with a serene and happy
indifference to all that the world might think or say about him.
This characteristic of his Royal Highness is satirized in another of the
&ldquo;sketches,&rdquo; where he is supposed to sing &ldquo;My Dog and My Gun,&rdquo;
as &ldquo;Hawthorn,&rdquo; in the then popular opera of &ldquo;Love in a Village.&rdquo;
His Royal Highness made himself a remarkable character in those
smooth-faced days by wearing a profusion of whisker and moustache
perfectly white. A rumour somehow got abroad and was circulated
in the tittle-tattle newspapers of the time, that at the instance of
some fair lady he had shaved off these martial appendages. The
cavalry for some unexplained reason were the only branch of the
service who were then permitted to wear moustaches, and in one
of his sketches, the artist places the smooth-shaved duke in the
midst of his brother officers, who regard him with the greatest
horror and amazement.</p>

<p>The Ministry which succeeded that of the Duke of Wellington
had entered office under express declaration that they would forthwith
apply themselves to the reform of the representation of the
people; and accordingly, on the 1st of March, 1831, a bill for that
purpose was actually introduced by Lord John Russell; but the
strength and violence of the opposition which could still be
mustered against it may be judged by the fact, that the second
reading was carried by the hopeless majority of <i>one</i> in the fullest
house that had ever been assembled. A dissolution took place
shortly afterwards, and the avowed intention of such dissolution had
been to obtain from the people at the general election (which
followed) a House of Commons pledged to support the Reform
Bill; indeed, the only test by which candidates were tried, was their
expressed pledge to support this particular measure. On the 24th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>243</span>
of June, 1831, Lord John Russell again moved for leave to bring
in a bill to amend the representation of England, and the difference
in the result obtained by the election is conclusively shown by the
fact, that the votes for the second reading were 367 against 231.
On the 13th of July it passed into Committee, and on the 7th of
September, the bill as amended in Committee was reported to the
House; the majority in favour of the motion for passing it was
found to be 109, the ayes being 345, and the noes 236.</p>

<p>The Reform Bill next day was carried up to the Lords by Lord
<span class="sn">The Reform Bill thrown out by the Lords.</span>
John Russell, attended by about a hundred of its staunchest supporters
in the lower House. These gentlemen appear to have
adopted the unusual mode of exciting the attention of the peers and
giving to the function they were performing a striking and theatrical
character, by accompanying the delivery of the bill to the Lord
Chancellor with their own characteristic &ldquo;Hear, hear.&rdquo; A cry of
&ldquo;order&rdquo; recalled them to a sense of the presence in which they
stood. In Doyle&rsquo;s contemporary sketch of <i>Bringing up our Bill</i>, this
incident is referred to. Lord Chancellor Brougham stands at the
bar of the House to receive it from the hands of the member who
leads the deputation (Lord John Russell); behind him we see Lord
Althorp, the Marquis of Chandos, and the Right Hon. John Wilson
Croker, who exchange signs with their fingers, showing that the proceeding
does not altogether meet with their approval. In the background
may be seen Sir Charles Wetherell, hated of the reformers of
Bristol, looking as opposed to the measure as ever; the bill, as we
know, was thrown out by the Lords in October, by a majority of 41.
The same month, its enthusiastic advocate, the Rev. Sydney Smith,
at a reform meeting at Taunton, compared the attempt of the
House of Lords to stop the progress of reform to a certain fictitious
Dame Partington of Sidmouth, who had essayed during the progress
of the great storm to arrest the progress of the Atlantic with her
broom. &ldquo;The Atlantic was roused,&rdquo; said the wit; &ldquo;Mrs. Partington&rsquo;s
spirit was up; but I need not tell you that the contest was
unequal. The Atlantic Ocean beat Mrs. Partington.&rdquo; Immediately
after this speech appeared the sketch of <i>Dame Partington and the</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>244</span>
<i>Ocean of Reform</i>, in which the character of the apocryphal and
obstinate dame is sustained by that vigorous opponent of the Reform
Bill, his grace the Duke of Wellington.</p>

<p>As the Lords had thrown out the Reform Bill, it was necessary to
<span class="sn">A Dead Lock.</span>
begin <i>de novo</i>. Accordingly, on the 12th of December, Lord John
Russell again moved for leave to bring in a new Reform Bill, which
passed the third reading by a majority of 116 on the 23rd of March,
1832, and its second reading in the House of Peers, by a majority of
nine, on the 14th of April. Then the fighting and opposition became
once more as strenuous and as sustained as ever. On a subsequent
division the ministry were left in a minority of thirty-five, whereupon
Earl Grey proceeded to the king, and tendered to his Majesty the
alternative either of arming the ministers with the powers they
deemed necessary to carry through their bill (which really meant a
power to create whatever new peers they might deem requisite for
the purpose), or of accepting their own immediate resignation. In
the course of the following day the king informed his lordship that
he had determined to accept his resignation rather than have
recourse to the only alternative which had been proposed to him;
and accordingly, on the 9th, Earl Grey announced in the House of
Lords, and Lord Althorp in the Commons, that the ministry was at
an end, and simply held office till their successors should be appointed.
The Duke of Wellington attempted to form an administration,
and failed&mdash;and his failure left matters, the ministers, and the
perplexed monarch, of course exactly &ldquo;as they were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The excitement occasioned by the Lords was tremendous. At
London, Birmingham, Manchester, and other large centres, simultaneous
meetings were held to petition the Commons to stop the
supplies. In the metropolis placards were everywhere posted, recommending
the union of all friends of the cause; the enforcement
of the public rights at all hazards; and a universal resistance to the
payment of taxes, rates, tithes, and assessments; the country in fact
was on the brink of revolution. At the meetings of the political
societies, even in the leading journals, projects were openly discussed
and recommended for <i>organizing</i> and <i>arming</i> the people; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>245</span>
population of the large towns was ready to be launched on the
metropolis. &ldquo;What was to be done&mdash;peers or no peers? A cabinet
sat nearly all day, and Lord Grey went once or twice to the king.
He, poor man, was at his wits&rsquo; end, and tried an experiment (not a
very constitutional one) of his own by writing to a number of peers,
entreating them to withdraw their opposition to the bill.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_111" href="#Footnote_111"><span class="sp">111</span></a> The
letter to which Mr. Charles Greville refers is evidently the following
circular:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
<p class="rt">&ldquo;<span class="sc">St. James&rsquo;s Palace</span>, <i>May 17th, 1832</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">My dear Lord</span>,&mdash;I am honoured with his Majesty&rsquo;s command to acquaint
your lordship, that all difficulties to the arrangements in progress will be obviated
by a declaration in the House to-night from a sufficient number of peers, that in
<i>consequence of the present state of affairs</i>, they have come to the resolution of dropping
their further opposition to the Reform Bill, so that it may pass without
delay, and as nearly as possible in its present shape.</p>

<p class="rt" style="padding-right: 5em;">&ldquo;I have the honour to be yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="rt">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Herbert Taylor</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Such a request, coming from such a quarter, was not only weighty
in itself, but necessarily implied after all that had taken place, that
his Majesty suggested this course as the only means of avoiding
the creation of a large number of additional peers. The majority
of the House were thus placed in the unenviable position of being
compelled to choose whether they would see a hundred members
added to the number of their opponents to carry a measure which
was hateful to them, or to abandon for a time their rights, privileges,
and duties as legislators. They chose the latter alternative, and
during the remainder of the discussion on the bill, not more than
between thirty and forty attended at any one time. By this means,
and this only, the bill was eventually carried.</p>

<p>On these grounds John Doyle appears to have founded his theory
that William the Fourth was a sincere convert to Reform.<a name="FnAnchor_112" href="#Footnote_112"><span class="sp">112</span></a> In one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>246</span>
of the &ldquo;sketches&rdquo; he shows us his Majesty in the character of
Johnny Gilpin carried along at headlong speed by his unmanageable
<i>grey</i> steed &ldquo;Reform.&rdquo; He flies past the famous hostelry at Edmonton,
where his wife and her friends (represented by the Duke of
Wellington and a party of Tories) are anxiously awaiting his arrival.
The turnpike-keeper (John Bull) throws open the gate to let him
pass, too delighted with the fun to think of any personal expense to
himself, and conscious that if the gate is shut the inexpert horseman
must come to unutterable grief. The bottles dangling at Gilpin&rsquo;s
waist are filled with &ldquo;Birmingham froth&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rotunda pop,&rdquo; in
allusion to the stump oratory of the Birmingham Political Union and
the Rotunda in Blackfriars Road. Hume and O&rsquo;Connell, the ardent
supporters of the bill, cheering with might and main, closely follow
John on horseback; while Sir Francis Burdett and Sir T. C. Hobhouse,
equally ardent advocates of Reform, join the cry on foot.
The frightened geese with coroneted heads represent, of course, the
peers, who had offered such determined opposition to the measure,
while the old apple woman rolling in the mud is no other than
poor Lord Eldon. The bird of ill-omen foretelling disaster is Mr.
Croker, Secretary to the Admiralty. Later on the same year (1832),
we find his Majesty represented as Mazeppa bound to the <i>grey</i> steed
Reform, several of the Conservative members of either houses of
Parliament doing duty as the wolves and &ldquo;fearful wild fowl&rdquo; that
accompany the rider in his perilous course. In another satire, the
king, supposed to have discovered his mistake, figures as Sinbad the
Sailor, vainly endeavouring to shake himself free of the old man of
the sea (Earl Grey), who however is too firmly seated on his
shoulders to be <span class="correction" title="amended drom disloged">dislodged</span>.</p>

<p>The Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s political convictions having prompted
<span class="sn">Unpopularity of the Duke of Wellington.</span>
him to be among one of the leading opponents to the Reform Bill,
he narrowly escaped serious injury at the hands of the London
rabble. On the 18th of June, 1832, having occasion to pay a visit
to the Mint, a crowd of several hundred roughs collected on Tower
Hill to await his return; and on making his appearance at the gate
he was hissed and hooted by the crowd, who followed him along the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>247</span>
Minories yelling, hooting, and using abusive language, their numbers
and threatening demeanour momentarily increasing. About half-way
up the Minories he was met by Mr. Ballantine, the Thames
police magistrate, who asked him if he could render him any assistance;
but the cool, courageous soldier simply replied that he did not
mind what was going on. When his grace had got to about the
middle of Fenchurch Street, one of the cowardly ruffians rushed out
of the crowd, and seizing the bridle with one hand attempted to dismount
the duke with the other, in which he would have succeeded
but for the courageous conduct of the groom and a body of city
police, who opportunely made their appearance at the time. The
mob had now grown as numerous as it was cowardly; but by the
exertions of the police, his grace was escorted through it and along
Cheapside without sustaining personal injury. In Holborn, however,
the rabble, growing bolder, began to throw stones and filth, and
the duke, followed by the <i>canaille</i>, rode to the chambers of Sir
Charles Wetherell, in Stone Buildings, Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, where he
remained, till a body of police arrived from Bow Street, by whom
he was escorted in safety to Apsley House. To make the outrage
more disgraceful, if possible, it happened on the anniversary of
the crowning victory of Waterloo; the mob, forgetting in their unreasoning
wrath the priceless services the great soldier had rendered
to the nation, whilst the cowardly rascals who composed it were the
very persons who could by no possibility be benefited by the provisions
of the bill in which they professed to take so great an interest.
On the night of the illumination which followed the passing of the
Act, they broke the windows of his grace and other opponents of the
measure; and in one of the contemporary <span class="cn">HB</span> sketches, <i>Taking an
Airing in Hyde Park</i>, the duke is seen looking out of one of his
broken window-panes. Before the end of the year he was visited by
serious illness, and the angry feelings his opposition to the measure
had provoked, and which had been gradually subsiding, were
suddenly followed by a complete reaction in his favour. <span class="cn">HB</span> commemorates
this in his sketch of <i>Auld Lang Syne</i>, which shows the
happy reconciliation between John Bull and the hero of Waterloo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>248</span></p>

<p>Consistently and conscientiously as the great duke had opposed
<span class="sn">Duel between the Duke of Wellington and Lord Winchelsea.</span>
what he considered the revolutionary tendency of the Reform Bill, it
must not be forgotten that it is to him that the Catholics owe the
benefits of the Act of 1829, which relieved them of the disabilities
under which they had so long suffered; and it must not be forgotten
too, that in this measure he had not only to contend with his own
repugnance to Catholic emancipation, but also with that of his chief
colleagues,&mdash;of the great majority of the House of Lords, and of
the king himself. With the latter indeed his task had been a very
difficult one; and it was only a few days before the meeting of
Parliament in the early part of 1829, that the consent of George
the Fourth had been obtained. Among the most strenuous of the
duke&rsquo;s opponents to the Catholic Relief Bill was the Earl of
Winchelsea, who, in the unreasoning bitterness of his anger, shut his
eyes to the injustice under which the Catholics had so long suffered,
and most unwarrantably charged his grace with an intention &ldquo;to
introduce Popery into every department of the State.&rdquo; These words
led to a hostile meeting in Battersea Fields on the 21st of March,
1829. Lord Winchelsea, after receiving the duke&rsquo;s fire, discharged
his pistol in the air, and there the affair ended, his second delivering
a written acknowledgment expressing his lordship&rsquo;s regret for having
imputed disgraceful motives to the conduct of the duke, in his pro-Catholic
exertions. Twelve months afterwards, on the 2nd of
April, 1830, Richard William Lambrecht was indicted at Kingston
assizes for the murder of Oliver Clayton, whom he had shot in a
duel in Battersea Fields on the preceding 8th of January. Lambrecht
had a narrow escape, for the judge in his summing up told
the jury that if they were of opinion that the accused met Clayton
&ldquo;on the ground with the intention, if the difference could not be
settled, of putting his life against Clayton&rsquo;s, and Mr. Clayton&rsquo;s
against his,&rdquo; the prisoner was guilty of wilful murder; and the jury,
finding on application to the learned judge that there were no
circumstances in the case to reduce the crime to manslaughter, by
way apparently of getting out of the difficulty, returned a verdict of
<i>not guilty</i>. This incident suggested the sketch entitled <i>A Hint to</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>249</span>
<i>Duellists</i>, in which the unsparing satirist places the duke in Lambrecht&rsquo;s
unenviable position before Mr. Justice Bailey, from whose
lips are proceeding a portion of the charge which he actually delivered
to the jury at the trial at Kingston assizes. Even the duke,
impassive as he appeared, must have felt the justice of this unsparing
but admirable sarcasm.</p>

<p>Another member of the royal family who frequently figures in the
&ldquo;sketches&rdquo; is the Duke of Sussex. He was a man of large frame,
and as remarkable for the blackness of his whiskers as the Duke of
Cumberland was conspicuous for the bleached appearance of these
hirsute adornments. At a meeting of the council of the London
University, he is reported to have said that for the promotion of
anatomical science he should have no personal objection to dedicate
his own body after death to the College of Surgeons for the purposes
of dissection. This hint was enough of course for <span class="cn">HB</span>, and his
royal highness accordingly figures in a contemporary satire as <i>A
great Subject</i> &ldquo;<i>Dedicated to the Royal College of Surgeons</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another prominent personage of <span class="cn">HB</span>&rsquo;s time, and a singular instance
<span class="sn">Sir Francis Burdett.</span>
of the change which frequently takes place in the political
convictions of public men, was Sir Francis Burdett. Commencing
his career as an ardent radical and reformer intolerant of abuses, he
finished it and astonished his former supporters by being returned
for Westminster in the Conservative interest. The political conduct
of this once celebrated man is of so unusual a character that a short
recapitulation of his career seems necessary, in order that the reader
may understand the satires we are about to describe. Notwithstanding
his expressed views in support of absolute purity of election,
his own election for Middlesex in 1802-4, is said&mdash;what with the
expenses and subsequent litigation&mdash;to have cost him upwards of
one hundred thousand pounds. On the 5th of May, 1807, he was
challenged by and fought a duel with Mr. James Paull, on Wimbledon
Common, the cause of quarrel being Sir Francis&rsquo;s refusal to act
as chairman at a gathering of Paull&rsquo;s supporters at the Crown and
Anchor Tavern, Westminster, in April. The duel terminated in
both the principals being seriously wounded. The same year he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>250</span>
was returned to Parliament to serve as member for Westminster,
which constituency he continued to represent for nearly thirty years.
Perhaps the greatest event of his life was his committal to the Tower
under the Speaker&rsquo;s warrant for a libellous letter published in <i>Cobbett&rsquo;s
Political Register</i>, of 24th March, 1810, in which he questioned the
power of the House to imprison delinquents. He at first resisted
the execution of the warrant, and being a favourite with the mob, a
street contest ensued between the military and the people, in which
some lives were lost. In 1818, we find him moving for annual
parliaments and universal suffrage, when the House divided with
the result of 100 to 2, the minority being composed of the mover
and seconder&mdash;that is to say, himself and Lord Cochrane. In 1820,
he was found guilty at Leicester of a libel on Government in a letter
to his constituents reflecting on the Manchester outrage of the preceding
year; a new trial was moved for by himself, but this was
refused, and he was sentenced the following February to three
months&rsquo; imprisonment, and to pay a fine of £2,000. In March,
1825, his resolutions for the relief of the Irish Catholics were carried
by a majority of 247 to 234; but in later life his restless spirit
gradually calmed down, and after the appointment of the Melbourne
Ministry in 1835, he surprised and disgusted his party by going into
opposition, principally (as he alleged) on account of the court which
they paid to O&rsquo;Connell and his followers in their agitation against
the Irish Established Church. For some time previous to the
sketch we are about to describe he had absented himself from the
House, and otherwise shown his distaste for the persons and principles
of the leading men of the party to which he had formerly
belonged. The busy-bodies who professed to be the exponents of
public opinion in Westminster, pressed him for an explicit statement
of his views, and eventually called upon him to resign, and he took
them directly at their word. The person brought forward to oppose
him was John Temple Leader, then member for Bridgwater, a name
which suggested to the artist the pictorial pun of <i>Following the
Leader</i>, the &ldquo;followers&rdquo; being Lord Melbourne, Lord John Russell,
Lord Palmerston, Mr. O&rsquo;Connell, Sir J. Hobhouse, Mr. Hume, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>251</span>
Sir William Molesworth. Notwithstanding the exertions of the
ministers and their friends to secure the election of Mr. Leader, that
gentleman was not only beaten by a very considerable majority, but
lost as a natural consequence his seat for Bridgwater, a fact which
suggested to the artist another able sketch, <i>The Dog and the Shadow</i>.
The election itself forms the subject of <i>A Race for the Westminster
Stakes</i>, in which the aged thoroughbred (Sir Francis), ridden by
Lord Castlereagh, beats the young horse Leader, jockey Mr. Roebuck.
Among the backers of the losing horse, Daniel O&rsquo;Connell
and Joseph Hume may be easily detected by the lugubrious expression
of their faces. The sketch of <i>A Fine Old English Gentleman</i>
was suggested by a remark made by the <i>Times</i> during the progress
of the contest, in which it described Sir Francis as &ldquo;a fine specimen
of the old English gentleman.&rdquo; In the left-hand corner of this
sketch the artist has placed a picture of the Tower of London, by
way of reminder of the days when the baronet was regarded not
so much in the light of &ldquo;a fine old English Gentleman&rdquo; as a radical
of the most advanced type, and as a martyr in the cause of public
liberty.</p>

<p>A change of opinion however is obviously a necessary incident
<span class="sn">Changes in Political Opinion.</span>
of political life, and we have ourselves witnessed some remarkable
instances of such versatility in our own days. In some cases these
changes are only temporary or partial, in others they are radical and
complete; sometimes they are dictated by conviction, at others by
necessity; occasionally they seem to be the result of absolute
caprice; while in not a few instances, I fear, we should not be very
far wrong in assigning them to feelings of disappointment or personal
or political pique. This tergiversation in public men forms the subject
of one of <span class="cn">HB</span>&rsquo;s happiest inspirations. In 1837 there appeared
at the Adelphi Theatre an American comedian named Rice, the
forerunner of the Christies and other &ldquo;original&rdquo; minstrels of our day,
who sang in his character of a nigger a comic (?) song, which, being
wholly destitute of melody, and even more idiotic than compositions
of that kind usually are, forthwith became exceedingly popular, being
groaned by every organ, and whistled by all the street urchins of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>252</span>
day. This peculiar production, which was known as &ldquo;Jim Crow,&rdquo;
was accompanied by a characteristic double shuffle, while every
verse concluded with this intellectual chorus:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td>
<div class="poemr">

<p>&ldquo;Turn about, and wheel about,</p>
  <p class="i2">And do just <i>so</i>;</p>
<p class="i05">And every time I turn about,</p>
  <p class="i2">I jump Jim Crow.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>In <i>Jim Crow Dance and Chorus</i> (the title of the sketch referred
to), we find the leading men of all parties assembled at a ball,
engaged in the new saltatory performance initiated by Mr. Rice. In
the left-hand corner we notice Lord Abinger, formerly Sir James
Scarlett, a Whig, who growing tired of waiting for the advent of his
own party to power, changed his political opinions&mdash;that is to say
&ldquo;jumped Jim Crow,&rdquo;&mdash;and was made Attorney General by the Duke
of Wellington. Next him is Lord Stanley, who commenced life as
a Whig and was a member of Lord Grey&rsquo;s Reform administration,
but unprepared to go the lengths which his party seemed disposed
to take, he too &ldquo;jumped Jim Crow,&rdquo; deserted them, and joined the
ranks of the Opposition. Lord Stanley&rsquo;s <i>vis-à-vis</i> is Sir James
Graham; in his early days he had distinguished himself by the
strength of his radical opinions, but as a member of Lord Grey&rsquo;s
cabinet, he suppressed these sentiments, and &ldquo;jumped Jim Crow&rdquo;
by confining himself more strictly within Whig limits. Conspicuous
amongst the performers is Lord Melbourne! When in office under
Mr. Canning he had made several anti-Reform speeches, but afterwards
became a member of the Government of Lord Grey by which
Reform was carried;&mdash;as Prime Minister he went far nearer to the
principles of absolute democracy than either Lord Grey or Lord
Althorp. Lord Melbourne&rsquo;s face, however, shows unmistakable
repugnance at finding that his numerous &ldquo;wheels about&rdquo; have
brought him face to face with O&rsquo;Connell, and he turns in disgust from
the famous agitator, who, with his thumb to his nose and his left arm
stuck in his side, shows that he has no intention of permitting him
to enjoy a <i>pas</i> all to himself. O&rsquo;Connell of course shows himself
complete master of the figure which he had danced so frequently;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>253</span>
one of the most shifty, unstable men of his day, he can scarcely be
called a politician, for like all agitators, the person he really sought
to serve was himself alone. He chopped and changed just as it
suited his purpose, and is properly introduced by the artist amongst
the most adroit and vigorous of the political double shufflers.</p>

<p>The Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel find themselves
<i>vis-à-vis</i>, in allusion to their conduct with reference to Catholic
Emancipation. Both had originally been consistent opposers of
the measure, which was at last carried by the influence of the very
men who before had been its most persistent adversaries.</p>

<p>But, if any one had &ldquo;turned about and wheeled about,&rdquo; it was Sir
Francis Burdett, and accordingly the artist introduces him as indulging
in a very flourishing <i>pas seul</i>; he wears a self-satisfied smirk, and
carries his thumbs in his waistcoat, in allusion to his own contention
that he had been always consistent. Yet this self-satisfied aristocratic-looking
personage not many years before had distinguished
himself as the most prominent of radical malcontents, and had been
drawn by his enthusiastic dupes through the city of Westminster in
a triumphal car, decorated with the symbols of liberty, and preceded
by a banner bearing the inscription, &ldquo;Westminster&rsquo;s Pride and England&rsquo;s
Glory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The queer figure in the cocked hat is Sir de Lacy Evans, who
figures as one of the dancers in allusion to his practice as compared
with his professions. In 1833 he obtained a seat for Westminster,
triumphing over his opponent Sir J. C. Hobhouse, who for fifteen
years had represented that constituency, both candidates professing
to be zealous advocates for the abolition of flogging in the army.
Sir de Lacy nevertheless, when commanding the British Legion at
St. Sebastian, &ldquo;jumped Jim Crow&rdquo; by flogging his soldiers without
mercy. Lord John Russell once sneered at every project of Reform,
but his Lordship, as we have seen, &ldquo;jumped Jim Crow&rdquo; by repeatedly
introducing the Reform Bill into the House of Commons, which was
mainly passed by his persistent exertions; very properly, therefore,
Lord John figures in <span class="cn">HB</span>&rsquo;s clever sketch among the most prominent
of &ldquo;Jim Crow&rdquo; double shufflers.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII.</h3>

<h5><i>THE POLITICAL SKETCHES OF</i> <span class="cn">HB</span> (<i>Continued</i>).</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Sydney Smith</span> said of little Lord John Russell, that he was &ldquo;ready
<span class="sn">Lord John Russell.</span>
to undertake <i>any</i>thing and <i>every</i>thing&mdash;to build St. Paul&rsquo;s,&mdash;cut for
the stone,&mdash;or command the Channel fleet,&rdquo; and this satire of the wit
was true. He tried politics and he tried literature, and few people
will say that he was entirely successful at either. As a politician,
for instance, his general capacity for getting himself and his party
into a mess, earned from the most intellectually powerful of his
political opponents the enduring title of &ldquo;Lord Meddle and Muddle.&rdquo;
He has not been dead very long, yet what reputation has he left
behind him as a dramatist&mdash;novelist&mdash;historian&mdash;biographer&mdash;editor&mdash;pamphleteer,
all of which <i>rôles</i> he essayed at some time or other
of his long and eventful career? His <i>Nun of Arronca</i> (1822)
fetches it is true an exceedingly high price, because having been
rigidly suppressed by its author it is now exceedingly rare. The
best that can be said of Lord John&mdash;and that is saying a great deal&mdash;is,
that he was a consistent Liberal according to his lights, and that
to him belongs the honour and glory of bringing about the great
measure of Reform, which, as we have seen, was, mainly through
his instrumentality, accomplished in 1832.</p>

<p>Lord John, as might have been expected, frequently appears in
the &ldquo;political sketches&rdquo; of <span class="cn">HB</span>. He cuts an amusing figure in one
where <i>Jonah</i> (Lord Minto) is about to be thrown overboard by
Lords Lansdowne, Palmerston, and Duncannon, by order of the
captain (Lord Melbourne), to appease the storm raised by Lords
Brougham and Lyndhurst in reference to a rumour that Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>255</span>
Minto (First Lord of the Admiralty), had instructed British cruisers
to stop all Sardinian vessels carrying warlike stores for Don Carlos.
Lord John, while clinging to the mast behind, and viewing with
terror the impending fate of his colleague, evidently solaces himself
with the conviction that his own weight is too insignificant to have
any material effect upon the safety of the ship. Minto owed his
safety to the Duke of Wellington, who therefore figures in the
sketch as the whale; for, although convinced that his lordship had
been imprudent, he successfully resisted Brougham&rsquo;s motion for
a copy of the instructions, and thereby succeeded in lodging poor
Jonah on dry land.</p>

<p>One of the &ldquo;sketches&rdquo; in which Lord John Russell figures
<span class="sn">Stamp Duty on Newspapers.</span>
reminds us of a remarkable discussion which possesses considerable
interest for every reader of the cheap newspapers of to-day. The
Chancellor of the Exchequer (the Right Hon. Thomas Spring Rice)
in opening his budget on the 6th of May, 1836, showed a disposable
surplus of £662,000 only, which he proposed (in the usual
way) to apply towards the reduction of taxation. He proposed, in
the first place, to consolidate the paper duties and to reduce their
amount in a manner which he proceeded to explain; and after
accounting for £200,000, the balance of the surplus he intended to
apply to the reduction of the stamp on newspapers. The duty
minus the discount was fourpence, which he proposed to reduce to
a penny, and to give of course no discount. The reader must not
suppose from the foregoing, however, that all the proprietors of
newspapers of that day paid the duty; on the contrary, the large
majority evaded it in every possible way. The measure in fact was
intended as much as a protection to the revenue as anything else, for
the sale of unstamped newspapers throughout the country had become
so extensive that no series of prosecutions was found effectual
to put them down. Every sheet, it is true, professed to bear
on it the printer&rsquo;s name; but the name so appended was in six cases
out of eight a false one. Exchequer processes were issued; all the
power of the law was set in motion; in the course of three weeks
three hundred persons had been imprisoned for selling unstamped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>256</span>
papers in the streets, but without in the slightest degree repressing
the illegal sale. The Chancellor argued that the loss which the
revenue would sustain in the first instance would be more than compensated
by the enormous increase of duty to be obtained from the
enlarged circulation; from the additional duty arising from the
greater consumption of paper; and from the very large increase
which might be expected from the produce of the duty on advertisements.</p>

<p>The opponents of the measure were of three classes: first, those
who looked upon the proposal as radical and subversive; secondly,
those who because a reduction is suggested in one quarter invariably
consider it the correct thing to propose it in another; and lastly,
the owners of the established newspapers of the day. The arguments
of the first class assumed the following form: &ldquo;In proportion
as any political party approaches more or less towards pure
democracy and the right divine of mere numbers, its interests will
require that the means should be increased of disseminating among
the lower classes, and as nearly gratuitously as possible, the exciting
and poisonous food which is at last to end in the revolutionary
fever.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_113" href="#Footnote_113"><span class="sp">113</span></a> The second class, strange to say, rested their hopes in this
instance on the singularly slippery basis of <i>soap</i>. Sir C. Keightley
moved (on the 20th of June) that instead of diminishing the stamp
duty on newspapers, the duty on hard and soft soap should be
reduced. The reduction of such duty would, he argued, by aiding
cleanliness, promote the health and comfort of the people, while the
lowering of newspaper stamps would do nothing of the kind, but
would tend rather to introduce a cheap and profligate press, &ldquo;one
of the greatest curses which could be inflicted on humanity.&rdquo; He
contended, moreover, that it was absurd to argue that the poor were
debarred from reading the public prints, when in a coffee shop, for
three-halfpence, they could obtain a cup of coffee and a sight of
every newspaper published in London. Mr. Barclay, one of the
members for Surrey, thought it impossible for any reasonable being
to hesitate between the relative virtues of newspapers and soap; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>257</span>
as for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, he could not believe for one
moment that if left to his own unaided judgment he would hesitate
to give his preference to the latter. The Chancellor nevertheless
avowed in the plainest terms his preference for newspapers, and his
conviction of the advisability of an immediate reduction in the
stamp duty; the result, after the lapse of less than forty years, has
conclusively proved the wisdom of the measure which he succeeded
in carrying.</p>

<p>Newspaper proprietorship was then a monopoly; and the argument
<span class="sn">Curious Arguments of the Newspaper Proprietors.</span>
by which the rich proprietor, the representative of the third class of
opponents, sought to maintain his monopoly cannot fail to amuse
the newspaper reader of to-day. The monopoliser who, to maintain
the character of his paper and to supply the public with the best and
earliest information, incurred the expense of procuring parliamentary
reports, obtaining foreign intelligence, anticipating the arrival of the
post by expresses, and by having correspondents in every quarter of
the world where matters of interest were going forward, said, that
should the measure pass, he must thenceforth either be content to
lower the tone of the public press by not giving the same amount of
accurate intelligence, or must carry on the contest with those who
went to no expense at all. &ldquo;The result would be not only the ruin
of the property of the newspaper proprietors and the destruction of
their property, but it would be something much more fatal to the
general interests of the country, for the editors of the present
respectable papers would not be able to compete with these predatory
publications, and would be compelled to forego that extent
of information which was then so accurately given. We should
have the newspaper press&rdquo;&mdash;mark this, ye omnivorous readers of
to-day, who commence with <i>The Times</i>, adjourn to the <i>Telegraph</i>,
peruse the pages of the <i>Morning Post</i>, wander through the columns
of the <i>Daily News</i>, and finish off with the express edition of the
<i>Globe</i> or <i>Evening Standard</i>, reserving your <i>Saturday Review</i>, your
<i>Truth</i>, and your <i>Vanity Fair</i> for Sunday solatium&mdash;&ldquo;we should
have the newspaper press simply reduced to this state: that no
longer would there be a regular and correct supply of information
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>258</span>
to the public respecting the debates of Parliament or <i>other important
matters, but there would be only such an amount and such a description
of information as could be furnished upon the inaccurate data of a man
who would not go to any expense in the use of the means at present
employed</i>.&rdquo; These were the views of the newspaper proprietors of
1836, as expounded by that respectable but distinctly Tory authority,
&ldquo;The Annual Register.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_114" href="#Footnote_114"><span class="sp">114</span></a></p>

<p>The measure of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, of which we
have attempted the foregoing explanation, appears to have suggested
to John Doyle his sketch of <i>The Rival Newsmongers</i>, in which the
leading men of all parties are represented in the act of endeavouring
to force the sale of their own journals. The scene is supposed to
be enacted in front of the Elephant and Castle, where we find the
&ldquo;Union Coach&rdquo; waiting to take up passengers,&mdash;the three who
occupy the roof being a Scotchman, indicated by his bonnet and
plaid, Paddy by his shocking bad hat, while in the portly, jolly-looking
party next him we have no difficulty whatever in recognising
honest John Bull. The three are listening to the appeals of
O&rsquo;Connell, close to whom is Mr. Roebuck, and behind him again
Mr. Hume. Sir Roger Gresley addresses himself to the insides,
and the person holding up his paper to the special notice of John
Bull is the Marquis of Londonderry. The driver of the coach is
Lord Melbourne, and the ostler little Lord John Russell.</p>

<p>The public man who perhaps of all others earned and deserved
<span class="sn">Lord Brougham.</span>
his place in the pictorial satires of the nineteenth century was
emphatically Brougham. The verdict of posterity on this restless
but unquestionably brilliant man of genius must of necessity be a
somewhat disappointing one; he aimed at being nothing less than
an Admirable Crichton, and such a character in the nineteenth
century, when every public man must be more or less talented,
more or less brilliant, would be an impossibility even to a genius.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>259</span>
A rival lawyer and political opponent, Sir Charles Wetherell is reported
to have said of him that he knew a little of everything but
law; and although this statement was spiteful and untrue, there is
no doubt of the truth of Mr. Greville&rsquo;s remarks, that his duty as
Chancellor was confined to appeals which <i>must</i> come before him,
lunacy and other matters over which he had sole jurisdiction, and
that &ldquo;nobody ever thought of bringing an original cause into his
court.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_115" href="#Footnote_115"><span class="sp">115</span></a> We think we may even go farther than this, and say that
no lawyer of the present day would dream of relying on Lord
Brougham&rsquo;s decisions. O&rsquo;Connell said of him, &ldquo;I pay very little
attention to anything Lord Brougham says. He makes a greater
number of foolish speeches than any other man of the present
generation. There may be more nonsense in some one speech of
another person, but in the number, the multitude of foolish speeches,
Lord Brougham has it hollow. I would start him ten to one&mdash;ay,
fifty to one&mdash;in talking nonsense against any prattler now living.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some amusing examples of his restless anxiety to figure on all
occasions in the character of an Admirable Crichton are given by
Mr. Charles Greville, whose &ldquo;Memoirs&rdquo; stand in much the same
relation to the graphic satires of the nineteenth century as the
&ldquo;Odes&rdquo; of Dr. Walcot do towards the caricatures of James Gillray.
&ldquo;Dined,&rdquo; says Mr. Greville (under date of 7th June, 1831), &ldquo;with
Sefton yesterday, who gave me an account of a dinner at Fowell
Buxton&rsquo;s on Saturday to see the brewery, at which Brougham was
the <i>magnus Apollo</i>. Sefton is excellent as a commentator on
Brougham; he says that he watches him incessantly, never listens
to anybody else when he is there, and <i>rows</i> him unmercifully afterwards
for all the humbug, nonsense, and palaver he hears him talk
to people.... They dined in the brewhouse and visited
the whole establishment. Lord Grey was there in star, garter, and
ribbons. There were people ready to show and explain everything.
But not a bit. Brougham took the explanation of everything into
his own hands; the mode of brewing, the machinery, down to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>260</span>
feeding of the cart-horses. After dinner the account books were
brought, and the young Buxtons were beckoned up to the top of the
table by their father to hear the words of wisdom which flowed from
the lips of my Lord Chancellor. He affected to study the ledger,
and made various pertinent remarks on the manner of book-keeping.
There was a man whom Brougham called &lsquo;Cornelius&rsquo; (Sefton did
not know who he was), with whom he seemed very familiar. While
Brougham was talking he dropped his voice, on which &lsquo;Cornelius&rsquo;
said, &lsquo;Earl Grey is listening,&rsquo; that he might speak louder and
nothing be lost. He was talking of Paley, and said that &lsquo;although
he did not always understand his own meaning, he always made it
intelligible to others,&rsquo; on which &lsquo;Cornelius&rsquo; said, &lsquo;My good friend,
if he made it so clear to others, he must have some comprehension
of it himself;&rsquo; on which Sefton attacked him afterwards, and swore
that &lsquo;he was a mere child in the hands of &ldquo;Cornelius;&rdquo; that he
never saw anybody so put down.&rsquo; These people are all subscribers
to the London University,<a name="FnAnchor_116" href="#Footnote_116"><span class="sp">116</span></a> and Sefton swears he overheard
Brougham tell them that &lsquo;Sir Isaac Newton was nothing compared
to some of the present professors,&rsquo; or something to that effect. I
put down all this nonsense because it amused me in the recital, and
is excessively characteristic of the man, one of the most remarkable
that ever existed. Lady Sefton told me that he went with them to
the British Museum, where all the officers of the Museum were in
attendance to receive them. He would not let anybody explain
anything, but did all the honours himself. At last they came to
the collection of minerals, when she thought he must be brought
to a standstill. Their conductor began to describe them, when
Brougham took the words out of his mouth, and dashed off with
as much ease and familiarity as if he had been a Buckland or a
Cuvier. Such is the man, a grand mixture of moral, political, and
intellectual incongruities.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_117" href="#Footnote_117"><span class="sp">117</span></a></p>

<p>If the part which Brougham&rsquo;s position as attorney-general to Queen
Caroline obliged him to take at the memorable period of the &ldquo;Bill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>261</span>
of Pains and Penalties&rdquo; had not closed the door of professional
advancement against him, he had most effectually locked it against
himself so long as her husband lived by the intemperate and ill-judged
language in which he alluded to that event in the speech which
he delivered at Edinburgh on the 5th of April, 1825.<a name="FnAnchor_118" href="#Footnote_118"><span class="sp">118</span></a> But Brougham
was constantly on the watch for its being opened, and on the very
day when George the Fourth died, that is to say on the 20th of June,
1830, he spoke in the House of Commons in eulogistic terms of the
new sovereign, praising him for allowing the Speaker to take the
oaths at an unusually early hour in order to suit the convenience of
members, a graceful act, which Mr. Brougham declared he hailed as
a happy omen of the commencement of an auspicious reign. The
astute K. C.&rsquo;s object did not escape the penetrating eye of <span class="cn">HB</span>, who
forthwith represented him as <i>The Gheber Worshipping the Rising
Sun</i>, in whose smiling face we recognise the unmistakable lineaments
of William the Fourth. The sun proved not unmindful of
the attention; for, on the formation of Earl Grey&rsquo;s ministry in 1830,
Mr. Brougham was made Lord Chancellor, with the title of Baron
Brougham and Vaux. The appointment took the nation by surprise;
for although a consistent upholder of Whig principles, he had always
maintained a peculiar and independent position with his party, and
was expected to prove rather an embarrassment than otherwise.
These expectations were fully realized, and there can be no doubt
that the sentiments which Lord Brougham&rsquo;s bearing as Chancellor
excited among his colleagues and contemporaries, excluded him for
the remainder of his life from all official life and employment.</p>

<p>With all his wonderful powers, however, Lord Brougham could
make, as O&rsquo;Connell asserted of him, as inconsiderate a speech as
any man. One of these speeches, which was delivered on the 14th
of August, 1833, in a debate on the bill for the abolition of slavery
in the West Indies, suggested to <span class="cn">HB</span> a happy subject. His lordship
is reported to have said that, &ldquo;the object of the clause [then under
discussion] was to make the black, from the moment that he arrived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>262</span>
on the shores of this country, a free man in all respects: to make
him eligible to sit in Parliament, either in the House of Lords, if
it should be his Majesty&rsquo;s pleasure to give him a title to a seat, or
in the other House if he should be elected.&rdquo; <span class="cn">HB</span>, with his usual
facility for seizing an idea, took his lordship at his word, and forthwith
elevated the emancipated &ldquo;nigger&rdquo; to the woolsack, clothing
him in the wig and gown of Lord Chancellor Brougham, and giving
him the features of the noble and learned lord himself: this sketch
bears the title of <i>A Select Specimen of the Black Style</i>.</p>

<p>The House of Lords was a lively place whilst my Lord Chancellor
Brougham was in office, and in the &ldquo;scenes&rdquo; in which he figured,
and which drew down upon him the hatred and resentment of his
contemporaries, he not unfrequently displayed a want of judgment
which was nothing less than lamentable. We might give many
instances of these regrettable scenes, but one shall suffice. On the
29th of September, 1831, the Lord Chancellor made the following
answer to a question put by the Marquis of Londonderry:&mdash;&ldquo;My
lords,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I beg to state to you once for all, that
I will not sit here to be <i>bothered</i> with questions which emanate
from the ridiculous ideas of certain absurd individuals who cannot
or will not see anything, however clear, and seem lamentably incapacitated
by nature from comprehending what is going on. Moreover,
I beg to state to the noble marquis, that for the future I will
answer no question of his,&mdash;will give him no information whatever.&rdquo;
The amazed patrician said in reply, &ldquo;As to the language which the
noble and learned lord has ventured to apply to me here, I will only
say that I shall wish those words to be repeated in another place.&rdquo;
The Lord Chancellor rejoined that he had said nothing which he
was not prepared to repeat elsewhere; and here the matter appears
to have ended, for strange to say it was the Marquis of Londonderry
and not the irascible Brougham who subsequently apologised,
a circumstance which occasioned the artist&rsquo;s satirical and telling
sketch of <i>The Duel that did Not Take Place</i>. These scenes do not
appear to have been the result of any mere ebullition of temper;
on the contrary, Brougham would seem to have delighted in these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>263</span>
undignified exhibitions. &ldquo;The Chancellor, who loves to unbosom
himself to Sefton, because he knows the latter thinks him the finest
fellow breathing, tells him that it is nuts to him to be attacked by
noble lords in the Upper House, and that they had better leave him
alone if they care for their own hides. Since he loves these assaults,
last night,&rdquo; continues Mr. Greville, &ldquo;he got his bellyful, for he was
baited by a dozen at least, and he did not come out of the <i>mêlée</i> so
chuckling and happy as usual.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_119" href="#Footnote_119"><span class="sp">119</span></a></p>

<p>Parliament was dissolved on the 15th of August, 1834, and by
that time his party, the king, and everybody else, had grown pretty
well tired of Lord Chancellor Brougham. His head would seem to
have been almost turned by his success; for he employed the recess
which followed the prorogation in making a sort of royal progress
through Scotland, parading the Great Seal on his way, to the great
disgust of the king, who seriously thought he had taken leave of his
senses, and protested against it being carried across the border. In
the course of this strange progress he reached Inverness in the
beginning of September, 1834, and was presented by the magistrates
with the freedom of their city. In returning thanks for this honour,
Lord Brougham said he was conscious &ldquo;that it was not owing to
any personal merits that he had received this mark of distinction at
their hands. First of all he owed it to the circumstance that he had
the honour of serving a monarch who lived in the hearts of his subjects.
He had enjoyed the honour of serving that prince for nearly
four years, and during that time he had experienced from his Majesty
only one series of gracious condescension, confidence, and favour.
To find that he lived in the hearts of his loyal subjects in the ancient
and important capital of the Highlands, as it had afforded him
(Lord Brougham) only pure and unmixed satisfaction, would, he
was confident, be so received by his Majesty, when he (Lord
Brougham) told him, <i>as he would by that night&rsquo;s post</i> (cheers), of the
gratifying circumstances.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_120" href="#Footnote_120"><span class="sp">120</span></a> So far, however, from being gratified,
the bluff sailor king was tremendously annoyed. These fulsome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>264</span>
adulations, and the ridiculous manner in which his eccentric and
embarrassing Chancellor tortured any personal attention to himself
(Brougham) into a personal compliment to his royal master,
thoroughly disgusted him. For some weeks previously <i>The Times</i>
had attacked the eccentric Chancellor with a constancy and vigour
of satire quite unexampled; the tide of ridicule was swelled by contributions
from the London and provincial press; Brougham made
some foolish speeches at Aberdeen and Dundee, which excited the
laughter of his enemies and the alarm of his friends. &ldquo;Those who
are charitably disposed,&rdquo; remarks the unfriendly Greville, &ldquo;express
their humane conviction that he is mad, and it probably is not very
remote from the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Intellectually strong as he was, a Chancellor so eccentric as this
was an <i>incubus</i> to be got rid of at the first convenient opportunity.
In May, 1834, Mr. Stanley, Sir James Graham, the Earl of Ripon,
and the Duke of Richmond, seceded from the ministry; but the
Whig party, in spite of these resignations and the subsequent one of
Lord Grey in July, continued in office under Lord Althorp till the
following November, when the latter being called (by the death of
his father) to the Upper House as Earl Spencer, the king seized
the opportunity which he had so long desired of placing a less
embarrassing and self-willed Chancellor on the woolsack. This
circumstance prompted the clever sketch of the <i>Fall of Icarus</i>.
Icarus in this instance is of course Brougham, who, flying in defiance
of the injunctions of Dædalus too near the sun&mdash;that is to
say, William the Fourth&mdash;the wax of his mechanical wings melted and
he fell into the sea. That there may be no mistake as to the artist&rsquo;s
meaning, the wings aforesaid are labelled with the titles of various
publications which were loudest in sounding the praises of the King
and of the &ldquo;noble and learned lord,&rdquo; and to which he himself, with
the questionable taste which distinguished him, was reputed (with
justice) to be a contributor.</p>

<p>Whether my Lord Chancellor Brougham caught the infection
from his client, Queen Caroline, we know not; but his conduct,
whether in or out of office, appears to have been of the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>265</span>
undignified character. Ignoring the fact that his party were no
longer in power, there is no doubt whatever that he wrote a letter
to his successor, Lord Lyndhurst, actually suggesting his own
nomination to Lyndhurst&rsquo;s vacant office of Chief Baron of the
Exchequer, thereby (as he pointed out) saving to the public his
own pension of ex-Chancellor. What his real motive may have been
is of little consequence; it was certainly a most undignified proceeding,
made the more undignified, if possible, because the proposal
was not accepted. It suggested to the artist one of his pictorial
puns, <i>The Vaux and the Grapes</i>, and to the Rev. Richard Harris
Barham the following amusing verses, which we have extracted from
a contemporary poetical skit:&mdash;</p>

<p>Lord Brougham, indeed, by his despotic, intractable conduct, had
thoroughly shut himself out from all chance of office. Sir Robert
Peel&rsquo;s Conservative ministry lasted till April, 1835, when a second
Whig government came into power, under the premiership of Lord
Melbourne, and from the re-constructed cabinet, Brougham&mdash;much
to his own surprise, but to the surprise of no one else&mdash;was
excluded.<a name="FnAnchor_122" href="#Footnote_122"><span class="sp">122</span></a></p>

<p>Irish disaffection was, unfortunately, as stale a subject in 1833
<span class="sn">Irish Disaffection.</span>
as in 1883. For what particular sins of her own England has been
cursed with a neighbour so bloodthirsty, so unreasonable, and so
troublesome as Ireland, it would be difficult to say. Although we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>267</span>
had no Irish Americans&mdash;no cowardly &ldquo;dynamitards&rdquo;&mdash;in those
days, Ireland was nevertheless in a state of chronic disaffection,
and an &ldquo;Irish Coercion Bill&rdquo; was found just as necessary to restrain
the excitement of Irish political malcontents in 1833 as in 1883.
Irish history, in this respect at least, has a method of repeating
itself which is singularly embarrassing, and the student of the
history of Irish disaffection cannot fail to be interested in the
statement with which Lord Grey introduced his measure fifty years
ago. We learn from this statement that a state of things existed
little short of actual rebellion. Bodies of men were collected and
arrayed by signals, evidently directed by a system of organization
in which many were combined, and such system was conducted in
a manner which had hitherto set at defiance all the exertions of
law and order. The disturbers of the peace prescribed the terms
on which land was to be let, and any one who presumed to disobey
their orders was subject to have his property destroyed or be put
to death. The reign of terror was complete. The organization
which supplied the place of the Land League of to-day dictated
what persons should employ and be employed; and while they
forbad labourers from working for obnoxious masters on the one
hand, they prevented a master on the other from employing as
labourers any but those who were obedient to their orders. They
enforced their decrees by acts of cruelty and outrage; by spoliation,
murder, attacks on houses in the dead of night; by dragging the
inmates from their beds and so maltreating them that death often
ensued, or by inflicting cruelties which were sometimes worse than
death. The persons belonging to this organization assembled by
signals, made concerted movements, watched the movements of the
troops, and by information received so avoided them that the
military were rendered practically useless.</p>

<p>The ordinary tribunals were powerless to arrest this iniquitous
organization of murder and terror, which the Irish disaffectants
and their advisers even in that day appear to have brought to a
system of execrable perfection. Witnesses and jurors were terrified
into silence. In one case the master of a female servant was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>268</span>
commanded to dismiss her because her <i>mother</i> had given evidence
against a person brought to trial for a capital crime, and similar
cases were of almost daily occurrence. Five armed men went
to the house of Patrick Lalor, a man of nearly seventy years of
age, and shot him through the body. His crime had been disobedience
to a mandate to give up some ground which he held
contrary to the will of the Terrorists. The same system prevented
a son of Lalor, and an eye-witness of his murder, from giving
evidence against his murderers. On the trial of these miscreants at
Kilkenny assizes, the jury not being able to agree was dismissed.
It had been arranged in the jury-room that nothing should transpire
as to the opinions of individual jurymen, and yet, in <i>half an hour</i>,
the names of those in favour of an acquittal or of a conviction
were printed&mdash;the former in black, and the latter, or as they were
designated the &ldquo;jurors who were for blood,&rdquo; in red ink. The result
was that those whose names were printed in red were obliged
to leave the country. At the Clonmel assizes the previous October
(1832), when a person was to be tried for resisting the payment
of tithe, only 76 jurors out of 265 who had been summoned
made their appearance. A gentleman had been murdered in sight
of his own gate in consequence of some dispute in connection with
tithes. The answer of his son-in-law, summoned by the coroner
to give evidence against the supposed murderer, was this: &ldquo;That
he would submit to any penalty the crown or the law would impose
upon him, but he would not appear at the trial, because he knew
that if he stood forward as a witness his life would inevitably be
forfeited.&rdquo; The Irish Government received a notice from Kilkenny
&ldquo;that many gentlemen who had always&rdquo; most conscientiously
discharged their duties, &ldquo;would not attend at the next assizes.
They cared not what penalty was imposed upon them. They
refused to attend, because they knew that death&rdquo; awaited them
if they dared to do their duty. &ldquo;It is the boast of the prisoners,&rdquo;
continued this document, &ldquo;that they cannot under existing circumstances
be found guilty.&rdquo; Under such a disgraceful state of things,
outrage had become of course triumphant. The sickening catalogue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>269</span>
of Irish cruelty and crime during the previous year comprised
172 homicides, 465 robberies, 568 burglaries, 455 <i>acts of houghing
of cattle</i>, 2,095 illegal notices, 425 illegal meetings, 796 <i>malicious
injuries to property</i>, 753 <i>attacks on houses</i>, 280 arsons, 3,156 serious
assaults, making an aggregate of crimes of every description during
the year, connected with the disturbed state of the country, exceeding
9,000 in number, and the number was evidently still on
the increase.</p>

<p>The third reading of the Coercion Bill was carried in the
<span class="sn">Effect of the Irish Coercion Bill of 1833.</span>
Commons on the 29th of March, by 345 to 86, and the Act was to
continue in force till the 1st of August, 1834. It led of course to
many scenes in the House between English and Irish members,
although the Irish members of that day, to do them simple justice,
had not graduated in the aggravated system of obstruction they
have since developed, and thereby earned for themselves the
character of political nuisances. One of these scenes led to the
sketch entitled <i>Prisoners of War</i>, which has reference to a serio-comic
interlude, in which the principal performers were Lord
Althorp and Mr. Shiel, member for Tipperary. On the 5th of
February, 1834, Lord Althorp charged (without naming them)
certain Irish members who had particularly distinguished themselves
by violent opposition to the Bill in the House, with using very
different language in reference to it in private conversation. Up
then rose one Irish member after another, inquiring if he was the
person alluded to. To Mr. O&rsquo;Connell and Mr. Finn the answer
was in the negative, while Mr. Shiel was given directly to understand
that <i>he</i> was one of the members intended, his lordship declining
at the same time to name his authority, but avowing his belief in
the truth of the story, and his willingness to take upon himself the
full responsibility. The result of course was a &ldquo;scene.&rdquo; Mr. Shiel,
after the manner of fire-eating Irishmen of that day, having hinted
his intention to demand satisfaction elsewhere, Sir Francis Burdett
arose and said that, unless the &ldquo;honourable members pledged themselves
to preserve the peace, he should instantly move that they be
committed to the custody of the Serjeant-at-arms.&rdquo; As neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>270</span>
of the parties would give such assurance, the motion was put from
the chair and carried. The <i>Prisoners of War</i> portrayed in the
sketch are of course Mr. Shiel and Lord Althorp. After a brief
absence from the House, each having given the required assurance
was discharged from custody, and there the matter ended. The
benefits of the Act were almost immediately made apparent.
The association, which called itself, by the way, &ldquo;The Irish Volunteers&rdquo;
(the Land League of 1833), was promptly suppressed by
the Lord Lieutenant; and the list of offences during the month of
March which preceded and the month of May which followed the
passing of the Act most conclusively proved its efficiency, for, while
in the former month the records of crime in eleven counties reached
a sum total of 472, they had declined in the latter month to 162.<a name="FnAnchor_123" href="#Footnote_123"><span class="sp">123</span></a></p>

<p>Irish agitators of the nineteenth century are all more or less
<span class="sn">O&rsquo;Connell.</span>
&ldquo;tarred with the same brush,&rdquo; but the conditions under which an
Irish agitator of 1883-4 must be content to figure in that character
are, it must be remembered, widely different from those which
influenced the agitators of 1833. The Irish &ldquo;Home Rulers&rdquo; have
sown the wind and have reaped the whirlwind which carries them
along in its progress, and we doubt whether if they wished to stop the
hideous Frankenstein they have created, it would allow them to do
so. The Home Rulers, however, are not in any way to be pitied.
Not content with Land League terrorism, they sought to force
their measures upon John Bull himself by an unheard-of system of
parliamentary obstruction, which has inevitably recoiled upon themselves.
O&rsquo;Connell was far too sharp-sighted&mdash;far too intelligent and
clever a man to make so grave a mistake as this. By the sheer
force of his genius he exercised for many years of his life a most
powerful influence on English politics. He figures in one of John
Doyle&rsquo;s sketches in the character ascribed to him probably by most
of his contemporaries. In the sketch referred to, the Governor of
Barataria is represented by the typical Irish peasant; O&rsquo;Connell
appears in the character of the Doctor; and Lord John Russell as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>271</span>
the attendant and amused servitor. Pat&rsquo;s eagerness to enjoy the
good things he has been led to expect, and his mortification at their
being removed out of reach and out of sight are ridiculously
rendered.</p>

<p>We must not be misunderstood; although O&rsquo;Connell had far
greater personal influence over the Irish than his successors, he was
for all that in political matters eminently unscrupulous.<a name="FnAnchor_124" href="#Footnote_124"><span class="sp">124</span></a> At the
general election of 1835, the avowed principles on which he stood
forth as a candidate were: repeal of the union,&mdash;universal suffrage,
vote by ballot,&mdash;triennial parliaments,&mdash;and the abolition of tithes.
&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;decidedly for the vote by ballot. Whoever votes
by ballot votes as he pleases, and no one need know how he votes.&rdquo;
Yet, in spite of these avowed principles, he controlled the election
of Irish candidates after the following fashion:&mdash;The Knight of
Kerry started as a candidate for his native county, but dared to
avow his intention to take an independent course. He had spent
all his life in resisting Orangemen, and yet O&rsquo;Connell said, &ldquo;Every
one who dares to vote for the Orange knight of Kerry shall have a
death&rsquo;s head and cross-bones painted on his door.&rdquo; The voters at
the Irish elections were collected in the chapels by the priests, and
led forth to the poll under threats of being refused all the rites
and visited with all the punishments of their Church. Under these
influences, the Knight of Kerry, supported by nearly all the
property, intelligence, and respectability of the county, was
defeated. Of a candidate for New Ross who had refused to enlist
under his banner, O&rsquo;Connell said, &ldquo;Whoever shall support him his
shop shall be deserted, no man shall pass his threshold; put up his
name as a traitor to Ireland; let no man speak to him; let the
children laugh him to scorn.&rdquo; His example was followed of course
by his lieutenants. It says something for Irish independence that
these unscrupulous &ldquo;dodges&rdquo; were not always successful; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>272</span>
O&rsquo;Connell himself, and his colleague, Mr. Ruthven, secured their
own seats by comparatively small majorities. At the previous
election O&rsquo;Connell had obtained a majority of 1,549, and Mr.
Ruthven of 1,490 above the highest Conservative candidate: at the
election in 1835, O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s majority had fallen to 217, and Mr.
Ruthven&rsquo;s to 169. The &ldquo;Irish agitator&rdquo; was manifestly no favourite
with <span class="cn">HB</span>, who depicted him as the comet of 1835. Comets being
supposed by the vulgar to portend disaster, it is represented as
leaving Ireland in a flame, and passing over St. George&rsquo;s Channel
to exercise a malign influence on peaceful England. The head of
course is that of O&rsquo;Connell, while the tail is studded with the
countenances of the Irish members who made up his &ldquo;following.&rdquo;
In a previous sketch he had figured as the Wolf to Lord John
Russell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Little Red Riding Hood,&rdquo; in allusion to a statement
made by the opposition journals that the Government had made
a league with the restless agitator with the view of securing his
support in the House of Commons. We have heard something
very like this lately, in relation to what is now known as the
&ldquo;Kilmainham Treaty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rapidity with which John Doyle caught an inspiration from
<span class="sn">Sir Robert Peel.</span>
a few chance words in a speech, may be aptly illustrated by the
manner in which he served Sir Robert Peel. On the occasion of
his being installed Lord Rector of Glasgow University, in November,
1836, the distinguished statesman made a speech to his patrons, in
which he meant to tell them that, admiring Scotland and Scottish
scenery, he thought the best mode of seeing both was on horseback
instead of travelling in a public or private conveyance. He
expressed the idea, however, in the following round-about fashion:&mdash;&ldquo;I
wished,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to see something of Scotland which I could
not have seen from the windows of a luxurious carriage; I wished
to see other habits and manners of life than those which the
magnificent hospitable castles of the nobility presented. Yes,&rdquo;
he continued, &ldquo;in Glasgow I hired an <i>humble but faithful steed</i>; I
travelled partly on horseback and partly on foot through almost
every county that lies southern of Inverness; I have read the map
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>273</span>
of Scotland upon the great scale of nature, from the summits of Ben
Nevis and Ben Lomond; I have visited that island whence savage
and roaming bands derived the benefits of knowledge and the
blessings of religion. Yes, amid the ruins of Iona I have abjured
the rigid philosophy which would conduct us indifferent and
unmoved over any ground that has been dignified by wisdom, by
bravery, and by virtue. I have stood on the shores of Staffa,&mdash;I
have seen the temple not built with hands,&mdash;I have seen the mighty
swell of the ocean,&mdash;the waves of the great Atlantic beating in its
inmost recesses, and swelling notes of praise nobler than ever
pealed from human organs.&rdquo; Well, other tourists besides the statesman
have stood on the summit of Ben Nevis and Ben Lomond,&mdash;have
visited Staffa and Iona,&mdash;and yet, the rigid philosophy which
Sir Robert credited himself for abjuring, has unconsciously conducted
them comparatively &ldquo;indifferent and unmoved&rdquo; over much
ground that may have been &ldquo;dignified by wisdom, by bravery,&rdquo; and
even &ldquo;by virtue.&rdquo; The stilted remarks of Sir Robert will serve to
remind some of us of the very original sentiments we find recorded
in &ldquo;visitors&rsquo; books&rdquo; of sundry home and continentals hotels much
affected by members of the gushing order of travellers. Some such
idea seems to have struck the artist; for in his next satire Sir
Robert very deservedly figured as <i>Dr. Syntax setting out on his
Humble but Faithful Steed in Search of the Picturesque</i>.</p>

<p>As a rule the titles of these sketches, which reach the amazing
number of nine hundred and seventeen, afford no clue whatever to
their subject matter. Here are the titles of a few, taken at random
from the general bulk:&mdash;<i>An Affair of Honour</i>; <i>A Group of Sporting
Characters at Epsom</i>; <i>A Nice Distinction, or a Hume-iliating Rejoinder
to a Warlike Ap-Peel</i>; <i>A Political Ruse</i>; <i>Swearing the Horatii</i>;
<i>Retaliation</i>; <i>Goody Two Shoes turned Barber</i>; <i>State Cricket Match</i>;
<i>Taking an Airing in Hyde Park</i>;&mdash;and so on. A description, however
short, of the events to which these &ldquo;Political Sketches&rdquo; refer,
would occupy probably a couple of volumes; and, following the
course which we have hitherto adopted, we have preferred to make
selection of a few which seemed to us&mdash;either from the persons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>274</span>
satirized or the scenes in which they figure&mdash;likely to interest the
general reader. Thackeray said of them at the time they were
appearing, &ldquo;You never hear any laughing at <span class="cn">HB</span>, his pictures are
a great deal too genteel for that,&mdash;polite points of wit which strike
one as exceedingly clever and pretty, and cause one to smile
in a quiet, gentlemanlike kind of way.&rdquo; Forty-two years have
elapsed since this was written;&mdash;the sketches fail now almost to
provoke the &ldquo;gentlemanlike kind&rdquo; of smile mentioned by the
humourist, for the events and the persons which caused it and to
which they relate have alike passed away out of sight and out of
memory.</p>

<p>The number which they attained is due no doubt in a large
<span class="sn">Faults of the &ldquo;Sketches.&rdquo;</span>
measure to the facility with which they were produced. They were
all drawn on stone, and exhibit the faults so often to be found in
the productions of artists who confine themselves to this material,
which, owing to the comparative facility of the process, has a
tendency to induce a slovenliness in execution unusual with artists
accustomed to the careful discipline under which a successful
etching on steel or copper can alone be produced. A writer in
<i>Blackwood</i><a name="FnAnchor_125" href="#Footnote_125"><span class="sp">125</span></a> says with much truth that <span class="cn">HB</span> &ldquo;would have been a
greater artist had he worked on the same material and with the
same tools as Gillray and Cruikshank, but we should probably not
have possessed so complete a gallery of portraits, comprising all the
men of note who took part in political affairs from before the passing
of the Catholic Relief Bill until after the repeal of the Corn Laws,
a period more eventful than any of a similar length since the
Revolution of 1688.&rdquo; John Doyle, too, had no great powers of
sarcasm, and he was timid in design, contenting himself with as few
figures as were possible for the purposes of his drawings. Robert
William Buss, himself a comic artist of ability, in his brief notice of
him charges him with a certain feebleness in the attitude of the
persons who figure in his sketches, and gives us to understand that
to balance a figure properly requires a knowledge and practice in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>275</span>
drawing to which <span class="cn">HB</span> was a stranger; and further, that by reason
of the absence of such knowledge and practice, he falls far behind
Hogarth, Gillray, Bunbury, Rowlandson, or the Cruikshanks. With
these artists indeed, as we have endeavoured to show, John Doyle
has nothing in common, and he evidently designed that no comparison
should ever be instituted between any one of them and
himself. His chief merits are to be found in the facility with which
he grasped an idea; the harmlessness and playfulness of his satire,
which wrought a complete revolution in the style and manner of
caricaturists; and above all in the excellence of his likenesses. The
best and most graceful of the series was produced just after the
wedding of her Majesty, and is a transcript (as it were) of Stothard&rsquo;s
beautiful design of <i>The Procession of the Flitch of Bacon</i>, the leading
personages being the young Queen and the late Prince Consort,
whose portraits are admirably executed. Towards the close of the
series they show signs of failing power, not unnatural in an artist
who during a course of twenty years had produced upwards of a
thousand drawings. I have seen it somewhere stated that this
deterioration dates from the period when the identity of <span class="cn">HB</span> was
discovered; but inasmuch as this secret had been practically
revealed long before the decadence commences, there is no just
ground for any such assumption.</p>

<p>The reputation of the &ldquo;Political Sketches&rdquo; was, however, ephemeral,
and considering their popularity and the eagerness with which they
were bought up at the time, it is surprising how completely they
have passed into oblivion. The name of <span class="cn">HB</span>, or of John Doyle, is
now not only &ldquo;caviare to the general,&rdquo; but it is amazing how little
until lately he was known even to men not altogether ignorant on
the subject of satirical art. A gentleman to whom I am indebted
for some valuable information, tells me that some three or four years
since &ldquo;a large number of <i>original</i> sketches (not the engravings)
were catalogued and announced for sale at Christies&rsquo;. I went,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;possibly to buy several, but (and it is curious as showing the
decadent interest in the pictures) no sale took place, because I was
told there was no one to buy. I think,&rdquo; my informant adds, &ldquo;that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>276</span>
I was the only person, or nearly the only person, in the room.&rdquo;
Distinguished people, however, had been to look at the drawings,
and among them the late Lord Beaconsfield.</p>

<p>The success of the artist produced, of course, a number of
imitators. Their productions were of various degrees of merit; but
like most imitations they generally accentuated the faults without
reproducing the excellencies of the model. Some of them are
entitled &ldquo;Political Hits,&rdquo; &ldquo;Royal Ramblings,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Belgian Trip,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Parisian Trip,&rdquo; and so on; some are signed &ldquo;Philo H. B.,&rdquo;
&ldquo;H. H.,&rdquo; &ldquo;B. H.,&rdquo; while others have neither initials or signature.
They comprise some eighty or a hundred plates at least, many of
which were probably suppressed, whilst others no doubt served the
useful purposes of the greengrocer, the bookbinder, or the trunk-maker;
and if, as we are told&mdash;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII.</h3>

<h5><i>JOHN LEECH.</i></h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">John Leech</span>, &ldquo;born in Bennett Street, Stamford Street, 29th August,
1817, and baptized (son of John Leech, vintner) 15th November,
at Christ Church, Blackfriars Road.&rdquo; Such is the entry I find in
the manuscript diary of his friend the late Shirley Brooks, now
before me, written a few days after the death of the gifted and
lamented artist. The &ldquo;John Leech, vintner,&rdquo; his father, here
referred to, was at one time proprietor of the London Coffee House
on Ludgate Hill. A late commentator says he &ldquo;was an Irishman,
a man of fine culture, a profound Shakespearian scholar, and [presumably
by way of apology&mdash;as if any such were needed] a thorough
gentleman.&rdquo; Be this as it may, he was not successful as a landlord,
and as a matter of fact depended in a great measure for his support
upon the talents of his remarkably gifted son.</p>

<p>Leech was only seven years old when his father sent him to the
<span class="sn">Early Days.</span>
Charterhouse. His arm had been broken by a fall from a pony,
and the effects of this accident debarred him from taking an active
part in the athletic sports of cricket, hockey, or football; but his
nature inclined him nevertheless to manly exercises, and despite
his excellence with the pencil, which was manifested at a remarkably
early age, he is said to have preferred the lessons of Angelo the
fencing, to those of Burgess the drawing, master. He was not distinguished
at school as a classical scholar, and Latin verses in
particular proved so serious a stumbling-block that he always got
a schoolfellow to do them for him. His famous friend and fellow-pupil,
Thackeray, carried an indelible personal reminiscence of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>278</span>
Charterhouse about him in the shape of a broken nose, a mark of
distinction which was earned in a pugilistic encounter with another
schoolfellow.</p>

<p>A reminiscence of John Leech&rsquo;s schoolboy days will be found in
one of his illustrations to &ldquo;Once a Week,&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_126" href="#Footnote_126"><span class="sp">126</span></a> which represents a
schoolboy perched in the topmost branches of a tree overlooking
the walls of the Carthusian playground. As the mail coaches bound
to the north passed the Charterhouse walls in the old coaching days,
the boys not seeing any just reason why they should be debarred
from the exhilarating spectacle, notched the trees and drove in
spikes at ticklish points, which enabled them to mount to the upper
branches, whence they could watch the coaches at their leisure. The
illustration referred to is labelled, <i>A Coach Tree</i>, but without
this explanation the reader would scarcely suspect (the letterpress
being of course silent on the subject) that the schoolboy represented
in the illustration is the artist himself. Leech always
retained a pleasant recollection of his old Carthusian school-days,
and frequently attended the festivities of the Charterhouse.</p>

<p>His early aptitude for the pencil was developed when he was only
three years of age. One of his early efforts attracted the attention
of Flaxman the sculptor, who advised that he should &ldquo;not be
cramped with lessons in drawing; let his <i>genius</i>,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;follow
its own bent, and he will astonish the world.&rdquo; This advice was so
far followed, that we believe we are justified in saying that beyond
the ordinary perfunctory drawing lessons obtained at school, he
received no other artistic education during the rest of his life. His
father, the &ldquo;profound Shakesperian scholar&rdquo; and &ldquo;perfect gentleman,&rdquo;
so little encouraged the bent of the boy&rsquo;s genius, that if he
had had his way he would have driven this square peg into a
very round hole. At sixteen years of age he took his son from
the Charterhouse, and shortly afterwards apprenticed him to an
eccentric person at Hoxton, nominally carrying on the profession
of a surgeon, and rejoicing in the name of Whittle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>279</span></p>

<p>This Whittle proved a perfect study to the young artist, and it is
possible that his connection with this eccentric personage had some
influence in deciding him not to follow a profession for which he
had but little sympathy. Whittle was a man of large frame and
muscular development, so far at least as the upper part of his body
was concerned, but the development extended no farther, his legs
being formed on much more slender proportions. His tastes were
decidedly athletic; he had rings let into the wall for the purpose of
practising gymnastics, and delighted in posing before his amused
pupils in the character of &ldquo;The Dying Gladiator,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hercules,&rdquo; and
other antique statues. The few patients he possessed had small
chance of professional attendance when Mr. Whittle was in training
for a walking or running match, or any other amateur athletic engagement.
&ldquo;When,&rdquo; says Shirley Brooks, &ldquo;lady patients, taking a walk,
are suddenly surrounded by a hurrying and shouting crowd, in the
middle of which, as they escape, they behold their medical adviser,
in quaint attire, rushing to pick up stones with his mouth, an early
termination of the relations between the healer and his patients is
not impossible.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_127" href="#Footnote_127"><span class="sp">127</span></a> A person of this kind was obviously out of his
element in a <i>learned</i> profession, and this Whittle eventually recognised,
and descended to his level by marrying one of his patients, a
widow who kept a neighbouring public. He found himself more
&ldquo;at home&rdquo; behind the bar in his shirt sleeves, and with ready
facility adapted himself to circumstances by drawing beer for his
former pupils and patients. Various stories have been told of this
eccentric personage, who is said (with what truth we know not) to
have commenced life as a Quaker, and ended it eventually as a
missionary.</p>

<p>Whittle the eccentric was afterwards immortalized by Leech as
<span class="sn">&ldquo;Rawkins.&rdquo;</span>
&ldquo;Rawkins&rdquo; in Albert Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;Adventures of Mr. Ledbury,&rdquo; which
made their appearance in &ldquo;Bentley&rsquo;s Miscellany.&rdquo; We cannot
advise those who would enjoy a hearty laugh to do better than refer
to Leech&rsquo;s comical etchings of <i>The Return of Hercules from a Fancy</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>280</span>
<i>Ball</i> (on a wet night, without his latchkey), and the <i>Last Appearance
of Mr. Rawkins in Public</i>, in which the <i>rencontre</i> of Mr. Whittle and
some of his female patients already referred to is superbly realized.</p>

<p>When Mr. Whittle and his practice had finally parted company in
the manner we have described, John Leech&rsquo;s indentures were transferred
to Dr. John Cockle, afterwards physician to the Royal Free
hospital. During part of his spasmodic medical course, he went
through the mystic performance at one time known as &ldquo;walking the
hospitals,&rdquo; and at St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s varied his attendance at the
anatomical lectures of Mr. Stanley&mdash;where he met other square pegs
intended for round holes, Albert Smith and Percival Leigh&mdash;with
sketches of his fellow-pupils and their medical lecturers. Many of
these, the earliest of his sketches, were in the possession of his
friend, the late Mark Lemon. Before his time was out, Leech
luckily resolved to throw his medical studies to the winds, and
to live wholly by the practice of his art.</p>

<p>His first work, published when he was eighteen years of age, was
entitled &ldquo;Etchings and Sketchings by A. Pen, Esq.,&rdquo; and consisted
of four quarto sheets, containing slightly caricature sketches of
oddities of London life, such as cabmen, policemen, street
musicians, and the like. He next tried his hand at lithography, and
produced some political satires not without ability; but these at
best were merely the tentative efforts of an artist who had not yet
discovered the bent of his genius, in consequence of being compelled
to accommodate himself to the standard of his early patrons&mdash;the
printsellers. Having drawn his design, Leech has been
known in those early times to spend a weary day in search of a
buyer, by carrying the heavy stone about with him from publisher
to publisher. The style of these tentative efforts may be judged by
the work which first brought him into notice, a poor caricature of
Mulready&rsquo;s envelope in commemoration of the establishment of
Sir Rowland Hill&rsquo;s cheap postage system, a reproduction of which
will be found in a late &ldquo;Biographical Sketch&rdquo; by Mr. Kitton.<a name="FnAnchor_128" href="#Footnote_128"><span class="sp">128</span></a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>281</span>
Although the pecuniary reward of this early effort was small, people
began to ask by whom it was executed; thus it was that his subsequently
well-known mark, the leech-bottle, first came into public
notice.</p>

<p>Specimens of these tentative efforts are of course scarce, but
occasionally the reader may fall in with odd numbers of the
&ldquo;Comicalities,&rdquo; issued some half century ago by the proprietors of
&ldquo;Bell&rsquo;s Life,&rdquo; in which may be found specimens of his early work
among impressions from the designs on wood of Kenny Meadows,
&ldquo;Phiz,&rdquo; and even Robert Seymour.<a name="FnAnchor_129" href="#Footnote_129"><span class="sp">129</span></a> Among these early efforts
may also be named &ldquo;The Boys&rsquo; Own Series&rdquo;; &ldquo;Studies from
Nature&rdquo;; &ldquo;Amateur Originals&rdquo;; the &ldquo;Ups and Downs of Life, or
the Vicissitudes of a Swell&rdquo;; and other etcetera.</p>

<p>When poor Seymour shot himself in 1836, the artist who was at
first selected to fill his place as illustrator of &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; was Robert
William Buss, who, failing however to supply the requirements of
Charles Dickens, was (as we shall afterwards see) quickly discarded.
Others, however, had applied to supply the place of the deceased
artist, and among them were Hablot Knight Browne (&ldquo;Phiz&rdquo;),
W. M. Thackeray, and John Leech; although the latter failed to
secure the appointment, he appears to us of all others the one best
fitted to pictorially interpret the author&rsquo;s creations. Thackeray was
so little conscious of the bent of his own genius that he seems at
this time to have had some thoughts of following the profession
of an artist, but happily failed so completely that he was induced
to follow up his alternative art of authorship, by which he achieved
his fame and reputation. Notwithstanding his failure, his implicit
faith in his own artistic powers remained unshaken to the end, in
which belief he has been followed by one or two writers who might
have known better.</p>

<p>It is not until 1840 that we find Leech had matured the style
and manner which afterwards made him famous; and accordingly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>282</span>
in this year we find designs which are thoroughly worthy of his
reputation. Among these may be named &ldquo;The Children of the
Mobility,&rdquo; seven lithographs (reproduced in 1875) dealing with the
humorous and pathetic episodes of the London street arabs; &ldquo;The
Comic Latin Grammar&rdquo;; &ldquo;The Comic English Grammar&rdquo;; and a
now exceedingly rare <i>jeu d&rsquo;esprit</i>, bearing the full title of &ldquo;The
Fiddle-Faddle Fashion Book and Beau Monde a la Française, enriched
with numerous highly coloured figures of lady-like gentlemen,&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_130" href="#Footnote_130"><span class="sp">130</span></a> a
most amusing skit upon the absurd fashion books of the period,
containing four coloured plates of gentlemen (more than fifty
figures) in male and female costume, posed in the ridiculous and
well-known simpering style of those periodicals. All these works
were produced in conjunction with Percival Leigh, one of the
artist&rsquo;s fellow-students at St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s, and led directly to his
engagement on the pages of <i>Punch</i>, which was started the following
year.</p>

<p>Among the rarer works published in 1840, to which John Leech
contributed the benefit of his assistance, may be mentioned a
publication, entitled &ldquo;The London Magazine, Charivari, and Courier
des Dames&rdquo; (Simpkin, Marshall &amp; Co.), in which we find some
portraits and other work altogether out of the range of his usual
style of illustration. The tone of this publication was personal
in the extreme. Charles Dickens had produced (among other
publications) his &ldquo;Pickwick Papers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Oliver Twist,&rdquo; &ldquo;Nicholas
Nickleby,&rdquo; and at this time was engaged on the most touching and
pathetic of his stories, &ldquo;The Old Curiosity Shop,&rdquo; which was, however,
so little appreciated by the editor of this scurrilous publication,
that we find him perpetrating the following sorry libel on the writer
and three of his contemporaries: &ldquo;To cheesemongers and others!
Ready for delivery, at a halfpenny per pound, forty tons of foundered
literature; viz., Mrs. Trollope&rsquo;s &lsquo;Unsatis-factory Boy,&rsquo;<a name="FnAnchor_131" href="#Footnote_131"><span class="sp">131</span></a> &lsquo;Master

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>283</span>

&rsquo;Alas, Poor Jack&rsquo;! and <i>Turpis</i> Ainsworth&rsquo;s &lsquo;Guy <i>Fox</i>&rsquo;:&mdash;</p>

<p>So little merit had this critical periodical itself, that some rare
etchings by Hablot Knight Browne and Leech to a novel entitled
&ldquo;The Diurnal Revolutions of David Diddledoff,&rdquo; which appeared in
its pages, failed to keep the dreary serial alive, and a quarrel ensuing
between the proprietors and himself, Browne was dismissed and
Leech supplied his place. Leech&rsquo;s caricature of Mulready&rsquo;s postage
envelope, already mentioned, appears to have led to others, and
among them one by &ldquo;Phiz,&rdquo; a circumstance which is referred to in
the following attack: &ldquo;Phiz has found a lower deep in the lowest
depths of meanness. When Leech&rsquo;s admirable caricature of Mulready&rsquo;s
postage envelope was pirated by every tenth-rate <i>sketcher</i>,
Phiz steps in to complete the work of injustice, and advertises his
caricature of the same subject at <i>sixpence</i>, thus both borrowing the
design and underselling the artist upon whose brains he is preying as
the fly upon the elk&rsquo;s. Well might Leech exclaim, &lsquo;Et tu, Brute!&rsquo;
(and you, you brute!) Leech is a genuine artist, while Phiz is only a
bad engraver.&rdquo; By way of answer to this vulgar abuse, Phiz almost
immediately afterwards produced his admirable illustration of <i>Quilp
and the Dog</i>, in No. 18 of &ldquo;Master Humphrey&rsquo;s Clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the pages of this defunct periodical we find a long and virulent
article on Benjamin D&rsquo;Israeli, the late Lord Beaconsfield, from
which we have disinterred the following remarkable prophecy. After
referring to his celebrated parliamentary <i>fiasco</i>, and his own prophetic
words on that memorable occasion: &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t hear me now;
but the time will come when you <i>shall</i> hear me!&rdquo; the writer goes
on to say: &ldquo;That time has never since arrived. In vain did Benjamin
parody Sheridan&rsquo;s celebrated saying (&rsquo;It&rsquo;s in me, and by G&mdash;&mdash; it
shall be out of me!&rsquo;). He renewed his efforts repeatedly....
But though, in consequence of his (<i>sic</i>) moderating his tone into a
semblance of humility, he is sometimes just listened to, he has never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>284</span>
made the slightest impression in the house, <i>and we may fairly predict
he never will</i>.&rdquo; The article is illustrated by a remarkable semi-caricature
likeness of the late Lord Beaconsfield, then in his thirty-second
year, which, although unsigned and altogether different from his well-known
style, we can assign to no other hand than that of John Leech.
We found our opinion on the fact that the previous portrait is by
him; that none but his etchings appear in the latter portion of the
book; and because the bird represented following the footsteps and
mimicking the walk of the young statesman, is own brother to the
celebrated Jackdaw of Rheims immortalized by Thomas Ingoldsby.
So remarkable is the likeness, that the shadow of D&rsquo;Israeli&rsquo;s follower
and that of Saint &ldquo;Jem Crow&rdquo; of the Legends are identical.</p>

<p>In 1840 some of John Leech&rsquo;s sketches were brought to the notice
<span class="sn">Artistic Position secured.</span>
of the Rev Thomas Harris Barham, which led to his engagement on
the pages of &ldquo;Bentley&rsquo;s Miscellany,&rdquo; from which moment his artistic
position was secured. His first illustration was <i>The Black Mousquetaire</i>.
Barham in describing the scene, regretted, oddly enough, that
he had neither the pencil of Fuseli or Sir Joshua Reynolds at command,
or had himself taken lessons in drawing:&mdash;</p>

<p>Leech continued on the pictorial staff of &ldquo;Bentley&rsquo;s Miscellany&rdquo;
ten years; his etchings therein commence with vol. viii. (1840) and
(practically) end with vol. xxv. (1849).<a name="FnAnchor_132" href="#Footnote_132"><span class="sp">132</span></a> Altogether he contributed
to this sterling periodical some one hundred and forty etchings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>285</span>
illustrating (amongst numerous scattered papers) &ldquo;The Ingoldsby
Legends&rdquo; (with Cruikshank); Henry Cockton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stanley Thorn&rdquo;;
Charles Whitehead&rsquo;s &ldquo;Richard Savage&rdquo;; Albert Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;Adventures
of Mr. Ledbury,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fortunes of the Scattergood Family,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Marchioness of Brinvilliers&rdquo;; W. H. Maxwell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Brian
O&rsquo;Linn,&rdquo; etc., etc.</p>

<p>From the time that he joined the <i>Punch</i> staff, in 1841, the life of
John Leech was one of well-earned prosperity and happiness. His
income at first gradually and then rapidly increased, and he moved
from the attic which he occupied in the vicinity of Tottenham Court
Road, into a house of his own at Notting Hill. Shortly after this he
married. Miss Ann Eaton was one of those English beauties that
Leech delighted to draw; and it is related of him that he first met
her walking in London, and, following her home, noted the house in
which she lived, ascertained her name, procured an introduction, and
straightway married her. The issue of this marriage was two children&mdash;a
boy and a girl. The former&mdash;John George Warrington Leech,
the miniature counterpart of his father in appearance and dress, and
inheriting in a marvellous degree his talent for drawing&mdash;was unfortunately
drowned at South Adelaide in 1876.</p>

<p>Leech&rsquo;s hand appears for the first time in the fourth number of
<i>Punch</i> (7th August, 1841),<a name="FnAnchor_133" href="#Footnote_133"><span class="sp">133</span></a> to which he contributed the well-known
full-page illustration of <i>Foreign Affairs</i>. His first cartoon, <i>A Morning
Call</i>, will be found at page 119 of vol. ii., and the reader
will find it worth his while to refer to it for the purpose of comparing
it with the later and better work with which he afterwards enriched
the pages of this famous serial, which mainly through his instrumentality
was steered into the current of prosperity which carried
it&mdash;after a time of considerable doubt and perplexity&mdash;<a name="FnAnchor_134" href="#Footnote_134"><span class="sp">134</span></a> steadily
onwards. One of <i>Punch&rsquo;s</i> most celebrated contributors has borne
testimony to the value of his services. &ldquo;Mr. Punch,&rdquo; says Thackeray
in reviewing his friend&rsquo;s contributions in 1854, &ldquo;has very good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>286</span>
reason to smile at the work and be satisfied with the artist. Mr.
Leech, his chief contributor, and some kindred humourists with pencil
and pen, have served Mr. Punch admirably.... There is no
blinking the fact that in Mr. Punch&rsquo;s cabinet John Leech is the
right-hand man.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_135" href="#Footnote_135"><span class="sp">135</span></a> That this was true is proved by the fact that
during his connection with <i>Punch</i>, extending over a period of three
and twenty years, he executed no less than three thousand pictures,
of which at least six hundred are cartoons.<a name="FnAnchor_136" href="#Footnote_136"><span class="sp">136</span></a> No wonder that when
he lay dead, Shirley Brooks&mdash;another valued contributor, and afterwards
editor of <i>Punch</i>&mdash;mournfully acknowledged that the good ship
had lost its &ldquo;mainsail.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_137" href="#Footnote_137"><span class="sp">137</span></a></p>

<p>Most admirable examples of his designs on wood will be found
<span class="sn">The &ldquo;Illuminated Magazine.&rdquo;</span>
in the first three volumes of &ldquo;The Illuminated Magazine,&rdquo; a delightful
serial which appeared in 1843-4, which also contains a
series of etchings on copper of unusual size and brilliancy. Associated
with him on the pages of this periodical, which is now
seldom met with, were his friends Thomas Hood and Mark Lemon,
Douglas Jerrold and Laman Blanchard, Albert Smith and Angus
Bethune Reach, Samuel Lover and Kenny Meadows. The world
was young with authors and artists alike in those days; the
youngest of the band were William Hepworth Dixon, then aged
twenty-two; John Leech, twenty-six; and Wilkie Collins, literally
not &ldquo;out of his teens,&rdquo; one of whose earliest literary productions
we find here under the title of &ldquo;The Last Stage Coachman,&rdquo;
illustrated by Hine. In these volumes appeared Douglas Jerrold&rsquo;s
delightful allegory of the &ldquo;Chronicles of Clovernook,&rdquo; to which the
veteran Kenny Meadows contributed some of the most quaint
and original of his sketches.</p>

<p>John Leech&rsquo;s portrait appears in three of the <i>Punch</i> sketches&mdash;two
only of which are due to his own hand; the first in January,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>287</span>
1846, in one wherein a servant maid is depicted as saying, &ldquo;If
you please, sir, here&rsquo;s the printer&rsquo;s boy called again;&rdquo; again, in
January, 1847, where we find him playing the clarionet as one
of the orchestra at <i>Mr. Punch&rsquo;s Fancy Ball</i>. Other performers
are&mdash;Mayhew, cornet; Percival Leigh, double bass; Gilbert à
Beckett, violin; Richard Doyle, clarionet; Thackeray, piccolo;
Tom Taylor, piano; while Mark Lemon, the conductor, appeals
to Jerrold to somewhat moderate his assaults on the drum. Another
hand portrays him seven years later, as armed with a porte
crayon he rides his hobbyhorse at an easel which does duty for
a hurdle, Jerrold is playing skittles, Thackeray holds the bat at
a game of cricket, and Mark Lemon is engaged at rackets.</p>

<p>Amongst the early <i>literary</i> contributors to <i>Punch</i> were Mark
<span class="sn">Douglas Jerrold.</span>
Lemon, Horace Mayhew, Gilbert à Beckett, Stirling Coyne, W.
H. Wills, H. P. Grattan, Douglas Jerrold, Percival Leigh, and
Dr. Maginn. Albert Smith joined the staff through the introduction
of his friend Leech; Thackeray was a later acquisition, in
1844. It was scarcely to be expected that the brilliant and the
lesser wits who shed their lustre on the early volumes of <i>Punch</i>,
and were brought together at the weekly council dinners, would
invariably agree;&mdash;Jerrold and Thackeray, for instance, entertained
a sort of constitutional antipathy to one another, and the latter,
it must not be forgotten, was (in the words of Anthony Trollope)
&ldquo;still struggling to make good his footing in literature&rdquo; at the
time he joined the ranks of the <i>Punch</i> parliament. Jerrold could
not veil his contempt for Albert Smith, angrily asking Leech at
one of the <i>Punch</i> gatherings, with reference to the former&rsquo;s free
and easy method of addressing his friend, &ldquo;Leech, how long is
it necessary for a man to know you before he can call you
&rsquo;Jack&rsquo;?&rdquo; When À Beckett announced his &ldquo;Comic History of
England,&rdquo; in 1846, the strong mind of Jerrold recoiled in horror
from what he deemed a sacrilege. Writing to Charles Dickens
in reference to the announcement, he said, &ldquo;After all, life has
something serious in it. It cannot be <i>all</i> a Comic History of
Humanity. Some men would, I believe, write the Comic Sermon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>288</span>
on the Mount. Think of a Comic History of England! The
drollery of Alfred! the fun of Sir Thomas More in the Tower!
the farce of his daughter begging the dead head, and clasping it
in her coffin, on her bosom! Surely the world will be sick of
this blasphemy!&rdquo; &ldquo;The Comic History of England&rdquo; appeared,
notwithstanding, and was followed afterwards by the &ldquo;Comic
History of Rome;&rdquo; and however we may sympathize with the
honest indignation of Jerrold, and condemn the questionable taste
of À Beckett, we have at least to thank the latter for some of
the drollest and most original designs which ever emanated from
the pencil of John Leech.</p>

<p>The eccentric and original costumes in which he draped the
classical characters of Rome appear to have been a favourite
idea with the artist. Shirley Brooks relates that he first made his
acquaintance at a fancy ball given at the house of their mutual
friend, the late John Parry. &ldquo;Leech&rsquo;s costume,&rdquo; says the late
editor of <i>Punch</i>, &ldquo;I well remember. It was something like Charles
Mathews, as chorus to Medea. The black trousers and patent
leather boots of decorous life were below; but above was the
classic tunic. Then in addition he wore a fine new hat, round
which, instead of around his head, was the laurel wreath; and
the Greek ideal was brought into further discomfiture by a pair
of spectacles and an exceedingly neat umbrella.&rdquo; This comical
idea will be found ridiculously amplified in his amazing designs to
&ldquo;The Comic History of Rome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Medical student, novelist, dramatist, humourist, and showman&mdash;for
<span class="sn">Albert Smith.</span>
some of us still remember his diorama of &ldquo;The Overland
Route&rdquo;&mdash;the most fortunate venture of Albert Richard Smith
(to give him his full name) was his ascent of Mont Blanc, which
formed the theme of a well-remembered lecture, in which his perils
amid rocky pinnacle, snow-field, and glacier lost nothing by the
graphic mode in which they were related. This &ldquo;ascent,&rdquo; by the
way, proved a source of profit to others besides himself; and we
should be curious to know the number of Chamounix guides and
hotel-keepers who were enabled through his indirect means to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>289</span>
retire into private life. The memory of Albert Smith is deservedly
cherished by the inhabitants of the distant Savoyard valley, for
he made the ascent of the &ldquo;Monarch of Mountains&rdquo; popular
among his countrymen, and thereby sowed the seed of a succession
of golden harvests, of which the primitive but thoroughly wide-awake
peasantry were by no means slow to profit. Dissimilar in
many respects, Albert Smith and John Leech had this bond of
sympathy between them, that both were old friends, and both
had nominally studied for the medical profession; and whilst
Leech attained at St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s that practical knowledge of
anatomical drawing which did him such good service in his
artistic career, Albert Smith at Middlesex Hospital and the <i>Hotel
Dieu</i> appears to have picked up that intimate acquaintance
with London and Parisian student life which he displays in the
&ldquo;Adventures of Mr. Ledbury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;New Monthly&rdquo; for 1844 contains two etchings by Leech
to &ldquo;The Lord of Thoulouse&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Wedding Day,&rdquo; which seem
to call for notice, because they are not to be found in the collected
edition of the &ldquo;Ingoldsby Legends.&rdquo; In the collected edition he
shows us little Jack Ingoldsby <i>before</i> he entered the fatal cellar,
while in the &ldquo;New Monthly&rdquo; we see him lying dead at the feet
of the weird buccaneer, who points with grim irony at the little
corpse by way of caveat to those who would broach his wine.
From the &ldquo;New Monthly&rdquo; etching George Cruikshank borrowed
the idea for his illustration of the same subject in the 1864 edition.
There is a difference, of course, but the fact will become ridiculously
patent to any one who has an opportunity of comparing the
two designs. This, by the way, is not the only instance in the
&rsquo;64 edition in which Cruikshank borrowed his idea from John
Leech,<a name="FnAnchor_138" href="#Footnote_138"><span class="sp">138</span></a> which at one time he would have scorned to do, a fact
which affords the strongest possible evidence of the decadence
of George&rsquo;s once unrivalled powers of invention, imagination, and
fancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>290</span></p>

<p>Leech it will be remembered obtained a footing on the staff
of &ldquo;Bentley&rsquo;s Miscellany&rdquo; at the time when George Cruikshank was
leaving it. Cruikshank, however, was an admirer of the genius of
Leech, and when they laid him in his untimely grave in Kensal
Green Cemetery, on the 4th November, 1864, the veteran artist was
among the crowd of distinguished men who looked sorrowfully on.
The influence which George Cruikshank exercised upon the genius
of Leech will be apparent to any one who has given attention to the
early etchings of the latter. This influence will be particularly discernible
in the illustrations to &ldquo;Richard Savage&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Marchioness
of Brinvilliers.&rdquo; Both were men of genius, but Leech&rsquo;s fancy
was of a tamer kind, and little inclined him in the direction of the
supernatural or the terrible. Leech, for instance, never produced
anything which equalled <i>Fagin in the Condemned Cell</i>; <i>The Murder of
Sir Rowland Trenchard</i>; <i>Xit Wedded to the Scavenger&rsquo;s Daughter</i>;
<i>Jack o&rsquo; Lantern</i>; or the reverie of the <i>Triumph of Cupid</i>. We
shall find but few diabolicals in his gallery of pictorial subjects, notwithstanding
which there is not a fiend in the whole of Cruikshank&rsquo;s
demon ranks who equals Leech&rsquo;s devil in Thomas Ingoldsby&rsquo;s
legend of &ldquo;The House-warming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It may seem invidious to institute a comparison between the two
men. Some, indeed, may hold that a comparison is impossible; but
we will quickly show that such a comparison is not only possible
but unavoidable. George Cruikshank, for instance, might or might
not have illustrated the &ldquo;Comic Histories&rdquo; of England and of
Rome better than John Leech; we may fancy, however, his hand on
the Surtees&rsquo; novels, the odd men, the strange coats, the eccentric
women, the podgy &ldquo;cockhorses,&rdquo; the wonderful dogs that would
have put in an appearance in the various sporting scenes and incidents
which form the subject of these &ldquo;horsey&rdquo; romances; we should
like, for instance, to see what he would have made of the pretty
serving woman who figures in the frontispiece of &ldquo;Ask Mamma;&rdquo;
how he would have treated the fair &ldquo;de Glancey&rdquo;; how he would
have grouped and dressed his figures at <i>The Handley Cross Ball</i>;
how he would have treated poor old Jorrocks when he fell into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>291</span>
shower bath. But, admirable as are Leech&rsquo;s book illustrations and
etchings, it is in the minor designs which he executed for <i>Punch</i>
during the short quarter of a century allotted to him that we must
seek for Leech&rsquo;s <i>genius</i>: it is these little drawings which place him
in the front rank of nineteenth century graphic satirists. They are
characterized by genuine humour and satire, unalloyed with a single
trace of ill-humour, exaggeration, or vulgarity. It was in this direction
that the artistic instincts of poor Robert Seymour inclined him;
but his imagination and invincible tendency to exaggerate, inherited
from the caricaturists who preceded him, failed to bear him beyond
the limited sphere of cockney sports and cockney sportsmen in
which his soul delighted. Here, we have the swells and vulgarians,
the flunkies and servants, the old men and maidens, the soldiers,
the parsons, the pretty women of English everyday life, placed in
situations more or less embarrassing, but presenting nevertheless
perfect types of the respective classes thus harmlessly and admirably
satirized. In this lies their chief value, and as years roll on and the
<i>Punch</i> volumes become scarce, this value will necessarily increase.</p>

<p>A shy and unobtrusive member of the society in which he moved,
<span class="sn">Abhorrence for Frenchmen.</span>
and which delighted in the enjoyment of his friendship, John Leech
was the keenest of observers, noting and satirizing as no one before
his time had attempted, or indeed had been able to do, the
cant and hypocrisy, the pride and selfishness, the upstart and arrogant
exclusiveness, the insular prejudices and weaknesses, which
form a part of our national character; but doing this, he loved his
countrymen and countrywomen for their finer qualities, and hated
the bungling foreigners who presume to caricature them without the
barest knowledge of their subject. This is the secret of the hearty
abhorrence which Leech always testified for Frenchmen. The ignorance
of his countrymen on the subject of English women has been
amusingly ridiculed by one of the most distinguished of their own
writers&mdash;Eugene Sue, in his novel of &ldquo;Mathilde&rdquo;:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>That</i> an Englishwoman!
Nonsense; there is nothing more easy to recognise than
an Englishwoman; you have only to look at her dress; it is simple
enough, in all conscience! A straw bonnet all the year through; a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>292</span>
pink spencer; a Scotch plaid petticoat, and bright green or lemon-coloured
boots; you may see the costume any day in <i>Les Anglaises
pour rire</i>, at the <i>Variétés</i>. We all know it is a Vaudeville, and it
would not be publicly acted unless it were authentic. I repeat it
once more, ever since this world has been a world, Englishwomen&mdash;real
genuine Englishwomen&mdash;have never been differently dressed.&rdquo;
M. Taine, who devoted himself to the study of our language and
literature, and spent much time amongst us, has (if I remember
rightly) admitted the errors which prevail amongst his countrymen
and women with reference to ourselves; but such observers as M.
Taine and M. Sue are unfortunately rare in France, and many have
essayed to depict us, with as much knowledge of their subject as
our Sir John Maundeville possessed when he sat down to write his
absurd but quaint and amusing &ldquo;Book of Voiage and Travaile.&rdquo;
John Leech resented this deplorable ignorance on the part of our
neighbours; and the <i>Punch</i> volumes are filled with biting sarcasms
on French habits, manners, and sentiments, which were keenly
felt, because, unlike the English who figure at the Variétés or in
French caricatures, in the dirty men who regard with astonishment
the English washstand at the exhibition, the cabs full of hirsute
monstrosities, the &ldquo;Flowers of the French army,&rdquo; the grimy Revolutionists
of Leicester Square&mdash;the hundred and one Frenchmen
who figure in the satires of John Leech, the Parisian recognises compatriots
whose ridiculous lineaments have been too faithfully reproduced
to render identification a matter of doubt or difficulty.</p>

<p>Leech executed very few illustrations for Dickens; and the
amusing blunder which he perpetrated in &ldquo;The Battle of Life,&rdquo; in
allowing the lady to elope with the wrong man, and the &ldquo;horror and
agony&rdquo; of the author in consequence thereof, have been set forth in
Forster&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life.&rdquo; The mistake was discovered too late for correction,
and remains a curious proof of the carelessness with which
distinguished artists will sometimes read the manuscript of an author
however illustrious.</p>

<p>The Surtees&rsquo; novels afford singular evidence of the keenness of
John Leech&rsquo;s critical observation. An ardent lover of sport himself,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>293</span>
and a frequent attendant at the &ldquo;Pytchley,&rdquo; when he went a day&rsquo;s
hunting it was his custom to single out some fellow disciple of
Nimrod that happened to take his fancy, keeping behind him all
day, noting his attitudes in the saddle, and marking every item of
his turn-out, to the last button and button-hole of his hunting coat.
It was in this way that he obtained the correctness of detail which
renders his famous sporting etchings so wonderfully true to nature.
Strange to say, notwithstanding his knowledge of every detail of the
huntsman&rsquo;s dress, even to the number of buttons on his coat, he
himself, with reference to his own outfit, invariably presented in the
hunting field a somewhat incongruous appearance. Either he would
wear the wrong kind of boots, or would dispense with some detail
which on the part of an enthusiast would be considered an unpardonable
omission. Leech, however, was not what is called a
&ldquo;rough rider,&rdquo; his constitutional nervousness prevented him indeed
from making a prominent figure in the hunting field, and his friends
attributed this want of attention to detail in dress to his sensitiveness
to criticism, and his unwillingness to place himself in any
position which would be likely to incur it.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV.</h3>

<h5><i>THE &ldquo;PUNCH&rdquo; CARTOONS OF JOHN LEECH.</i></h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">We</span> have seen that at the time John Leech commenced work as a
comic artist, the art of caricature was practically dead; it was not
therefore at all surprising, under the circumstances, that he should
reverse, as it were, the order of things: commence as an illustrator
of books, and finish his career as a graphic humourist. Although
his first contribution to <i>Punch</i> commences in the fourth number, his
cartoons so called (from which, in accordance with the plan of this
work we now proceed to select a few examples) seem to us to call
for little mention before the year 1843.</p>

<p>His Royal Highness Prince Albert, who held high rank in the
<span class="sn">Prince Albert.</span>
British army by virtue of his exalted position, was most unjustly
suspected in those early <i>Punch</i> days of a desire to interfere unduly
with its administration. He took, however, much interest in the
dress and comfort of the British soldier; and those who remember
what military costume was in 1843, will admit that there was room
for improvement. Changes were made indeed, but these changes
can hardly be said to have been made in the direction of either
comfort, convenience, or good taste. The &ldquo;Albert hat&rdquo; (as it was
called), one of the ugliest, most ungainly, and preposterous of military
shakoes that was ever invented, made its appearance about this
time, and the idea was credited (rightly or wrongly) to the amiable
prince. Constant reference to this preposterous invention is made
in the pages of <i>Punch</i>, and the prince&rsquo;s questionable taste in the
matter of military costume is specially satirized in Leech&rsquo;s amusing
cartoon entitled <i>Prince Albert&rsquo;s Studio</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>295</span></p>

<p>Mr. O&rsquo;Connell, at a great Repeal meeting held in September,
1843, had expressed a hope that he should be able to give his dupes
&ldquo;as a new year&rsquo;s gift a parliament on College Green.&rdquo; No one
knew better than himself the absurdity of such a promise. Had he
named the first of April for the presentation instead of the first of
January, it would have been more appropriate, and at least equally
veracious. A great Repeal meeting was intended to be held in
October at Clontarf, three miles from Dublin, at which certain supporters
of the movement were to have attended on horseback and
paraded in the character of the &ldquo;Repeal Cavalry.&rdquo; This meeting
the Irish executive prohibited by proclamation, and on the 14th,
O&rsquo;Connell and other prominent leaders were arrested, and held to
bail on a charge of conspiracy. On the 24th of May, 1844, the
Irish judges sentenced him to twelve months&rsquo; imprisonment, and
a fine of £2,000. The cartoon of <i>The Probable Effects of Good
Living and no Exercise</i> refers to this result; but <i>Punch</i> on this
occasion was wrong. O&rsquo;Connell proved &ldquo;too many&rdquo; for the Irish
lawyers. He appealed by writ of error to the Lords, and on the
4th of September the judgment was reversed.<a name="FnAnchor_139" href="#Footnote_139"><span class="sp">139</span></a> Sir James Graham,
the Home Secretary, and the government to which he belonged,
had encountered much odium in consequence of the opening of
certain letters which had passed through the post office. The result
was the appointment of a Committee of Secrecy by both Houses to
inquire into the official practice, and it would appear from their
report that every administration had been in the habit of exercising
this espionage under the authority of a warrant of the Secretary of
State. The sins of the past as well as of the present were visited
on the head of Sir James, who sought to throw the responsibility on
higher powers; and in reference to this, Sir James Graham and Sir
Robert Peel figure respectively as <i>Sairey Gamp</i> and <i>Betsey Prig</i>,
after Phiz&rsquo;s well-known drawing. Sir James indeed seemed to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>296</span>
had rather a facility for getting himself into trouble. There was
much excitement in and out of the House with reference to the
additional grant to Maynooth College. In the course of the debates,
Sir James Graham retracted an expression which he said had fallen
from him in the heat of debate, viz. that concession in favour of
Ireland had reached its utmost limit, and hoped that his actions
had proved better than his words. Among the subsequent cartoons
by Leech, he figures as <i>Peel&rsquo;s Dirty Little Boy</i>. &ldquo;Drat the boy,&rdquo;
says Dame Peel (as she chastises him), &ldquo;he&rsquo;s <i>always</i> in a mess.&rdquo;
Towards the close of the debate two remarkable speeches were
delivered by Lord John Russell and Sir Robert Peel, both of whom
concurred in the necessity of a conciliatory policy towards Ireland.
This <i>rapprochement</i> between the two leaders of the opposite camps,
and the leanings of Sir Robert in the direction of a Liberal policy,
are referred to in Leech&rsquo;s cartoons of <i>How do you Like the New
Whig?</i> and the <i>Premier&rsquo;s Fix</i> (Peel between Free Trade and Protection),
the last borrowed from one of Cruikshank&rsquo;s drawings. <i>The
Railway Juggernaut of 1845</i> (also suggested by Cruikshank&rsquo;s well-known
etching), refers to the then mania for dabbling in railway
shares.</p>

<p>Between the two stools of Free Trade and Protection, Sir Robert,
as might have been anticipated, ultimately fell through; an event
which is chronicled in vol. x., the idea in this instance being taken
from the celebrated drawing in the late Mr. Clarke&rsquo;s &ldquo;Three
Courses and a Dessert,&rdquo; the cartoon of Peel driving the vehicle of
Protection, which has broken down, bearing the title of <i>The Deaf
Postilion</i>. A change of ministry took place in 1846, little Lord
John replacing Sir Robert Peel as &ldquo;First Lord of the Treasury.&rdquo;
He cuts an amazingly queer figure (in vol. xi.) in the ex-premier&rsquo;s
huge hat, vast coat, and voluminous waistcoat and inexpressibles.
Little Lord John was an enduring subject of <i>Punch&rsquo;s</i> satire during
that statesman&rsquo;s somewhat unsatisfactory political career, and Leech
was never weary of comparing him with his far more brilliant and
able contemporary. Here we have the pair figuring as <i>Dombey
and Son</i> (Dombey being Sir Robert, and the son Lord John),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>297</span>
&ldquo;Mr. Dombey was in a difficulty. He would like to have given him
(<i>the boy</i>) some explanation involving the terms circulating medium,
currency, depreciation of currency, paper, bullion, rates of exchange,
value of precious metals in the market, and so forth.&rdquo; The <i>Portrait
of a Noble Lord in Order</i> refers to one of those exhibitions of want
of tact, taste, and temper in which Lord Brougham would seem to
have delighted.<a name="FnAnchor_140" href="#Footnote_140"><span class="sp">140</span></a> &ldquo;Who calls <i>me</i> to order?&rdquo; cries the &ldquo;noble and
learned&rdquo; lord, &ldquo;Who calls <i>me</i> to order? Pooh! Pooh! Fiddle-de-dee!
I never was in better order in my life. Noble lords don&rsquo;t
know what they are about;&rdquo; a conspicuous and aggressive appurtenance
of the &ldquo;noble and learned,&rdquo; by the way, is his preposterous
umbrella. One of the most barbarous and disgraceful of London
neighbourhoods in 1847, and for many years afterwards, was Smithfield;
the present generation can form no idea of the state of things
thirty years ago, which is referred to in the cartoon of <i>Punch and
the Smithfield Savages</i>, the artist borrowing his idea from West&rsquo;s
well-known picture of &ldquo;Penn&rsquo;s Treaty with the Indians.&rdquo; The
odious matrimonial swindle perpetrated by Louis Philippe with the
idea of ultimately seating a member of his family on the Spanish
throne, which has cast an indelible stain on his memory, had now
been found out, and attracted universal indignation. We find him,
in reference to this shameless piece of business, figuring as the <i>Fagin
of France after Condemnation</i>, the idea being suggested of course by
Cruikshank&rsquo;s famous etching in &ldquo;Oliver Twist.&rdquo; Retribution overtook
the mercenary monarch in the year of disquietude and national
unrest&mdash;1848; foreign kings and potentates were sent flying in all
directions, and Louis Philippe, who, like the rest of his family had
learnt nothing by misfortune, was among the first to go. <i>Put Out</i>,
one of the best of the artist&rsquo;s political cartoons, represents an armed
<i>ouvrier</i> clapping the cap of <i>liberté</i> by way of extinguisher on the
French candle (King Louis). Uneasy were the heads which wore
crowns in that year; and to the throned and unthroned sovereigns,
the former of whom watched these untoward events with nervous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>298</span>
interest, John Leech presented a seasonable gift in the form of <i>A
Constitutional Plum Pudding</i>, served up by Mr. Punch on Magna
Charta, and curiously compounded of &ldquo;Liberty of the Press,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Common Sense,&rdquo; &ldquo;Order,&rdquo; &ldquo;Trial by Jury,&rdquo; &ldquo;Religion,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;True Liberty of the Subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among the sovereigns who had a peculiarly insecure seat at this
period was Mastai Ferretti, better known as Pope Pius IX. His
temporal power was weak, whilst his spiritual dominion, as might
have been expected, had never been much stronger. To bolster up
the former, and at the same time find employment for his troops,
Louis, Prince President of the French Republic, sent an army to
Rome, thus affording matter for the speculation of his countrymen,
who were puzzled to know what possible concern a French Republic
could have with the affairs of the Papacy. Allusion to this is made
in Leech&rsquo;s cartoon of <i>The French Cock and the Roman Eagle</i>, in
which the bird of higher caste, chained and fettered, is unable to
offer anything like fair resistance to his unwilling antagonist. In a
<i>Bright Idea</i>, we have the apostle of peace (whose uncompromising
arguments in its favour have driven us before now in the direction
of war) figuring as a recruiting sergeant, and endeavouring to enlist
the &ldquo;Iron Dook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In no country perhaps are women more cruelly used than among
<span class="sn">General Haynau.</span>
the poorer classes of England, while in no country under the sun is
greater sympathy expressed for the weaker sex; a paradox which
was strikingly exemplified in 1850. The Austrian General Haynau
in that year paid a visit to this country. Some time before he had
earned unenviable notoriety by his treatment of the wives and
daughters of Hungarian insurgents who fell into his hands, and it
was reported, probably with much exaggeration, that regardless of
sex and condition he had subjected these hapless fugitives to the
indignity of corporal punishment. The rising had been however
some time repressed, and there was every reason to believe that in
this country at least the rumour had been forgotten. Among the
sights the General had been recommended to visit in London was
the celebrated brewery of Messrs. Barclay &amp; Perkins, and no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>299</span>
sooner was his presence discovered, than he was simultaneously
attacked by the draymen, and narrowly escaped with his life. He
got small sympathy from <i>Punch</i>, who, in vol. xix., presented Leech&rsquo;s
<i>Sketch of a Most Remarkable Flea found in General Haynau&rsquo;s Ear</i>.
&ldquo;<i>Who&rsquo;s Dat Knocking at de Door?</i>&rdquo; is a question put by Johnny
Russell to old Joe (Hume), who once in every session in those days
stood knocking at the door with his banjo labelled, &ldquo;Extension
of the Suffrage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Macaulay, writing in 1840,<a name="FnAnchor_141" href="#Footnote_141"><span class="sp">141</span></a> referred to the progress of what he
<span class="sn">The &ldquo;Papal Aggression.&rdquo;</span>
happily termed &ldquo;The Catholic Revival of the Nineteenth Century.&rdquo;
This revival was never more clearly exemplified than at the very
time the temporal power was most seriously endangered. Such of
the temporal power, indeed, as was left to it has gone, probably
for ever; while the spiritual power of the Papacy, at least in
Protestant England, as must be patent to any one who has given
the subject the smallest attention, has unostentatiously but enormously
increased, especially within the last twenty years. The
year 1850 was remarkable for what was then known among us as
the &ldquo;Papal Aggression,&rdquo; and <i>Punch</i> and his &ldquo;right-hand man&rdquo;
were exceedingly angry. Among the cartoons which they fulminated
on the occasion were the following: <i>The Guy Fawkes of 1850</i> [<i>i.e.</i>
the Pope] <i>Preparing to Blow up all England</i>; <i>The Thin End of the
Wedge</i> [the Pope trying with his jemmy, labelled &ldquo;Roman Archbishopric
of Westminster,&rdquo; to force the doors of the English Church].
It is both a singular and significant circumstance, that at this time
the Ritualists, or rather Puseyites, were helping on the work of
Rome by promoting, if not schism, at least dissension in the Church
of England by advocating the strictest attention to the letter instead
of the spirit of the rubric and liturgy. We find, in special reference
to the assistance thus, in some cases we believe unconsciously,
rendered to the Romish Church, <i>The Puseyite Moth</i> flying into the
Roman Catholic candle; and <i>Fashion in 1850, or a Page for the
Puseyites</i>, in which we see the Bishops of Lincoln, Oxford, and
Exeter dropping the hot poker of Puseyism, and the Pope, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>300</span>
monkey, making a <i>catspaw</i> of <i>poor Pus(s)ey</i> [the Doctor lately
deceased]; again, in vol. xx., Punch (a boy) inquires of an episcopal
showman, who holds the model of a church on his stand, &ldquo;Please,
Mr. Bishop, which is Popery and which is Puseyism?&rdquo; To which
the episcopal showman replies, &ldquo;Whichever you like, my little
dear&rdquo;; another cartoon represents a Puseyite parson who has received
&ldquo;warning&rdquo; from his cook. Inquiring the reason of her
dissatisfaction, he receives the following reply: &ldquo;Well, sir, the fact
is I aint equal to them Fast days; for what with a hegg here, and
a hegg there, and little bits of fish for breakfastes, and little bits
of fish for dinners, and the sweet omelicks, and the fried and
stewed hoysters, and the Bashawed lobsterses, and one think and
the hother, there&rsquo;s so much cooking that I aint even time to make
up a cap!&rdquo; Another influential person besides Mr. Punch was
terribly indignant at this aggressive movement on the part of the
Papacy, and loudly avowed his determination to go any length to
put a stop to it. This was my Lord John Russell, who, after
vapouring like &ldquo;ancient Pistol,&rdquo; quietly sneaked off after his
usual fashion, and did nothing. He got, however, a well-merited
dressing from Leech, who showed him up in his true character
in a contemporary number as <i>The Boy who Chalked up &ldquo;No Popery,&rdquo;
and then Ran Away</i>. It was these Papal satires (as we shall afterwards
see) which led to the secession from <i>Punch</i>, and the consequent
loss to satiric art, of one of its most genial and capable
professors, the late Richard Doyle;<a name="FnAnchor_142" href="#Footnote_142"><span class="sp">142</span></a> a loss followed (if we may
so term it) by a compensating gain. Richard Doyle&rsquo;s place was
almost immediately taken by an artist of great and exceptional
power, for more than twelve years the friend and coadjutor of
John Leech&mdash;Mr. Tenniel, who makes his first appearance in
<i>Punch&rsquo;s</i> twentieth volume.</p>

<p>The long peace which followed the national and European
struggle with Napoleon had produced a curious effect upon ourselves.
While Russia took advantage of the lull to recruit her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>301</span>
colossal forces, and Prussia to perfect the military system which
took us so much by surprise half a century afterwards, we, on the
other hand, wearied with our long and arduous struggle, had fallen
asleep, and dreamed pleasantly that the &ldquo;Millennium&rdquo; was at hand.
With this idea apparently in our minds, we inscribed on the walls
of the Great Exhibition of 1851, the Scriptural text which tells us
that &ldquo;swords shall be beaten into ploughshares and spears into
pruning hooks, neither shall they learn war any more.&rdquo; A significant
commentary on the text was found in the fact that many
of the exhibits at the &ldquo;World&rsquo;s Fair&rdquo; consisted of cannon, rifles,
and other lethal instruments of improved method and construction,
intended for the wholesale destruction of the human race. We
read the Scriptural text, and viewed these exhibits as relics of a
barbarism which had existed six and thirty years before, oblivious
of the circumstance that an incompetent general had &ldquo;wiped out&rdquo;
a British army in Afghanistan, and that we had crushed the empire
of Runjeet Singh on the banks of the Sutlej not so many years
before. The closing of the Exhibition is commemorated by a
cartoon, in which Leech shows us the famous Amazon putting on
her bonnet and shawl, chatting the while with Hiram Power&rsquo;s
Greek Slave, who, habited in &ldquo;bloomer&rdquo; costume, prepares likewise
to take her departure. Allusion to the bribery and corruption
prevalent at a notorious borough of that day is made in a sketch
which depicts the <i>Horror of that Respectable Saint, St. Alban&rsquo;s, at
Hearing the Confession of a St. Alban&rsquo;s Elector</i>.</p>

<p>Remarkable results were destined to follow the year of unrest&mdash;1848.
<span class="sn">The Coup D&rsquo;état.</span>
Louis Philippe had been replaced in France by Louis Napoleon,
who seems to have been elevated to the Presidency of the
Republic because he was considered to be so absolutely harmless,
the principle followed being analogous to that observed at the election
of a Pope, which has resulted more than once in an unpleasant
surprise for the cardinal electors. Those who had formed a low
estimate of his abilities, found that Louis was no longer the &ldquo;half-saved&rdquo;
youth of Boulogne and Strasburg; that he had learnt some
stern lessons in the hard school of adversity; that he had developed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>302</span>
moreover, a firm and decided will of his own. We thought it a
hazardous experiment on the part of French Republicans, for Louis
held a craze on the subject of his uncle&rsquo;s &ldquo;ideas,&rdquo; and the craze had
sufficient &ldquo;method&rdquo; to induce us to believe that he was the last man
who would have been selected to fill the presidential chair. As a refugee
in England, we had given him small credit for sagacity; and as
an emperor and a man, history has already said of him that he was
cunning, unreliable, and thoroughly unscrupulous. Although a comparison
between the two men is impossible, there was at least this
similarity between the two Napoleons, that both were indebted for
their elevation to the imperial purple to a revolution; here, however,
all resemblance ceased. The first Napoleon relied upon himself
alone, while Louis was advised by counsellors and adventurers
wiser and more unscrupulous than himself, and who were prepared
to back his fortunes with a view of advancing their own. At the close
of 1851, Europe was electrified by the unexpected and dastardly
blow delivered by these men, and by means of a &ldquo;great crime,&rdquo; the
history of which has been so graphically related by Victor Hugo,
Louis Napoleon, Prince President of the Republic, found himself
master of the destinies of France. The event is referred to by John
Leech in the cartoon of <i>France is Tranquil!!!</i> which she cannot
well fail to be, seeing that we find her bound hand and foot; a
chain-shot fastened to her foot, and a sentry menacing her with his
bayonet. The next volume shows us the Prince President in the
act of being measured by his military tailor, while he offers money
to his cast-off mistress <i>Liberté</i>, her mother (France) looking indignantly
on. Immediately behind, a priest (in allusion to the support
which the Papal party were receiving from this &ldquo;eldest son of the
Church&rdquo;) helps himself from a plate of money which stands by the
President&rsquo;s side; the floor is littered with miscellaneous articles,&mdash;bayonets,
knapsacks, imperial and other crowns, crosses of the
legion of honour, the <i>code Napoleon</i>,&mdash;and, in reference to Louis&rsquo;s
craze on the subject of his uncle and his &ldquo;ideas,&rdquo; one of Napoleon&rsquo;s
old boots. On a stool stands a bust of the first Napoleon, and on a
chair to the right a roll of &ldquo;Imperial purple.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>303</span></p>

<p>By the year 1853, the only persons who steadily shut their eyes to
the signs of the times, and continued steadfastly to believe in the
immediate advent of the &ldquo;Millennium,&rdquo; were the peace-at-any-price
party (represented by Messrs Bright and Cobden), the members
of the Peace Society, and the very strange people who obstinately
opposed any attempt on the part of England to provide for her
national safety by putting her defences in order. To the Peace
Society, Leech especially addressed his cartoon of <i>No Danger</i>,
which represents a donkey braying in front of a loaded cannon;
while to the mischievous lunatics who opposed any scheme of
national defence, he dedicated an appropriate gift in the shape of
<i>A Strait Waistcoat Worked by the Women of England</i>.<a name="FnAnchor_143" href="#Footnote_143"><span class="sp">143</span></a> By this
time John Bull had awoke from his dreams, and tacitly admitting
that the time for conversion of his swords into ploughshares and his
spears into pruning hooks had scarcely arrived, adopted the far
more sensible method of sending his troops to the camp at Chobham
by way of getting them acclimatized to the trials and vicissitudes
of wind and weather. This step leads of course to a
number of little pleasantries. In one cartoon we see an officer of
household cavalry parting his hair in front of his cuirass, whilst a
soldier servant brings him his shaving water in a bucket; another,
entitled <i>A Cold in the Head</i>, represents an officer in this melancholy
condition, who requests his servant to bring him his bucket of gruel
as &ldquo;sool as he has tallowed his loze.&rdquo; John, in fact, had been
aroused from his slumbers by the Emperor Nicholas, who, thinking
it a good time to appropriate Turkey, was suspected of having
offered a slice to Austria. The rumour is referred to in the cartoon
of <i>The Old &lsquo;Un and the Young &rsquo;Un</i>, in which we see the Russian and
Austrian Emperors at table with a bottle of port between them,
&ldquo;Now then, Austria,&rdquo; says Nicholas, &ldquo;just help me to finish the
Port(e).&rdquo; In another cartoon, John Bull nails the Russian eagle to
his barn door, remarking to his French friend the while, that <i>he</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>304</span>
&ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t worry the Turkeys any more.&rdquo; Lord Aberdeen, who, notwithstanding
the signs of the times, refused like Nicholas to believe
in a war with England, is represented placidly smoking the <i>Pipe of
Peace</i> over a barrel of gunpowder.</p>

<p>Thanks to Messrs Bright and Cobden, who obstinately persisted
in opposing the popular feeling which had set in steadily in the
direction of war,&mdash;thanks to the exertions of the Peace Society, who
were not restrained from sending certain zealous members of their
body to the Emperor Nicholas, who not unnaturally supposed that
these broad-brimmed gentlemen represented the sentiments of the
great English people,&mdash;but thanks above all to the French Emperor
and his astute advisers, who were enabled to take advantage of the
state of English feeling to hoodwink the &ldquo;great nation&rdquo; by the
prospect of an alliance with a great and respectable power, the
year 1854 found us in actual conflict with Russia, starting off after
our usual fashion with a handful of men to attack the strongest fortress
in Europe, provided with an unlimited supply of men and
metal and inexhaustible stores of warlike <i>materiel</i> of all kinds.
In vol. xxvi. we see Her Majesty <i>Throwing the Old Shoe</i> after
her Guards, who, for the first time since 1815, are seen setting
out on foreign service. Another cartoon, which has reference to our
<i>Bombardment of Odessa</i>, is divided into two parts, in one of which we
see Lord Aberdeen (whose dream of peace had been so rudely dissipated),
and in the other Nicholas of Russia, both reading the newspaper.
Says Aberdeen, &ldquo;Bombardment of Odessa! Dear me, this
will be very disagreeable to my imperial friend!&rdquo; Says the Emperor,
&ldquo;Bombardment of Odessa! Confound it! this will be very annoying
to dear old Aberdeen!&rdquo; In November, 1854, occurred our
disastrous victory of Inkermann, in which scarcely four thousand
English troops found themselves opposed by forty thousand Russians
and drove them into flight. No thanks, however, to our allies, who&mdash;with
the exception of sixty brave Zouaves and their lieutenant, who
played truant from their regiment to give us timely assistance&mdash;either
looked on or absolutely ran away.<a name="FnAnchor_144" href="#Footnote_144"><span class="sp">144</span></a> Spectators of this battle were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>305</span>
two of the Imperial family, a circumstance alluded to in vol. xxvii.
by Leech&rsquo;s cartoon of <i>The Russian Bear&rsquo;s Licked Cubs, Nicholas and
Michael</i>.</p>

<p>Picton remarked of our officers, when <i>en route</i> to Waterloo, that
<span class="sn">The Purchase System.</span>
with fifty thousand of his own men, and <i>French</i> officers at their
head, he would march from one end of Europe to the other. But
both the quality of French officers and soldiers had deteriorated
at the time of the Crimean War, and was destined still further to
deteriorate until the utter unsoundness of their military discipline
was laid bare years afterwards by Prussia. The French had no
generals, while we had <i>one</i> general and an excellent body of soldiers.
Unquestionably the Russian war did us the service of thoroughly
exposing the rottenness of our military system so far as concerned
the officering of the army. The principle followed was precisely
that complained of by Sir Thomas Picton forty years before; there
was no actual test of fitness until it came to be subjected to the
practical test of emergency; money invariably had the advantage
of merit, not only in the appropriation of first commissions, but
in the purchase of subsequent regimental grades, which were given
in exchange for pecuniary value, and not as a reward for military
efficiency. The material thus obtained was splendid as regards
manliness and bravery, but something more than these were wanted
in the absence of a leader like the great Duke; and although the
type selected is an extreme one, the result may be indicated by my
Lord Cardigan, who, though equal to any amount of endurance and
heroism, proved himself incapable of the exercise of the smallest
particle of common sense. The scandal of the then existing system
of purchase was aptly exposed by the artist in vol. xxviii., where we
find a rich titled old lady in a shop served by military counter-jumpers,
one of whom, wrapping up a lieutenant-colonelcy for her
boy, inquires, in the well-known jargon of the trade, &ldquo;What is the
next article?&rdquo; in answer to which she expresses a wish to have &ldquo;a
nice majority for his little brother&rdquo;; a wounded officer with his
arm in a sling timidly inquires the price of a captain&rsquo;s commission,
and turns wearily away on finding the preposterous price (£3,694)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>306</span>
is wholly beyond his means. Fortunately for us (for events proved
that in trusting to French assistance we were leaning on a broken
reed indeed!) the Russian rank and file, besides being badly led,
were as inferior to our own in endurance and pluck as they were
superior to us in the mere matter of numbers. Justly wondering
why forty thousand men, supported by twenty thousand reserves,
had failed to hold their own against a mere handful of British
infantry, Nicholas nevertheless treated the result apparently in a
philosophical spirit, and calmly asked his people to wait for
&ldquo;Generals <i>Janvier</i> and <i>Fevrier</i>.&rdquo; But the brave man&rsquo;s heart was
broken, and when February came it found the Imperial prophet
a corpse.<a name="FnAnchor_145" href="#Footnote_145"><span class="sp">145</span></a> The death of this great and disappointed man is forcibly
commemorated by Leech&rsquo;s memorable cartoon of <i>General Fevrier
Turned Traitor</i>. Lord John Russell, true to his character of &ldquo;Lord
Meddle and Muddle,&rdquo; had done nothing for us at the Congress, and
in <i>The Return from Vienna</i>, Her Majesty catches the frightened
little statesman by the collar and angrily asks him, &ldquo;Now, sir, what
a time you have been! What&rsquo;s the answer?&rdquo; To her Lord John&mdash;&ldquo;Please
&rsquo;M&mdash;there is&mdash;is&mdash;is&mdash;is&mdash;isn&rsquo;t any answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An English general in those days was so scarce a commodity
that in Lord Raglan we seemed absolutely to have exhausted the
supply: one old incapable was replaced by another, until the dearth
of English military ability became at length nothing less than an
absolute scandal. In <i>What we must Come to</i>, reference is made
to this lamentable state of things, wherein an old woman in bonnet
and shawl, with a capacious umbrella, applies for a post to Lord
Panmure (the Minister of War), &ldquo;Oh, if you please, sir, did you
want a sperity old woman to see after things in the Crimea? No
objection to being made a Field Marshal, and glory not so much
an object as a good salary&rdquo;; in another (<i>A Grand Military Spectacle</i>)
we find the heroes of the campaign engaged in inspecting the
Field Marshals, a pair of decrepid, purblind, old men seated in
arm chairs; in the third we recognise the amiable Prince Consort,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>307</span>
who was most unjustly suspected in those days of a desire to
interfere in the administration of our military matters&mdash;it would be
moonshine to term it military <i>system</i>, as we had none. <i>The New
Game of Follow my Leader</i> is a palpable hit at a practice common
enough too in those days. Applications were frequently made by
officers for leave to return home on the plea of &ldquo;urgent private
affairs,&rdquo; and you were astonished to see gentlemen walking about
whose duty it was to be with their regiments in the Crimea. In the
cartoon referred to, a long line of soldiers is drawn up in front
of the general&rsquo;s tent; a little drummer boy steps out of the ranks,
and making the usual salute inquires, &ldquo;Please, general, may me
and these other chaps have leave to go home on <i>urgent private
affairs</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A more unsatisfactory state of things for the belligerents all
round than this miserable Crimean conflict can scarcely well be
imagined. Lord Raglan, who had learned war by practical experience
under the eye of the great Duke himself, speedily realized
the fact that he had been made the victim of French military
jealousy and imbecility, the leaders having been selected not on
account of their military efficiency, but solely for attachment to the
cause of the Emperor. The battle of the Alma had been won
without the assistance of the French, who for all practical purposes
might just as well have been away.<a name="FnAnchor_146" href="#Footnote_146"><span class="sp">146</span></a> Marshal St. Arnaud, who, to
do him simple justice, was at this time dying literally by inches, had
refused to follow up the defeated Russians,<a name="FnAnchor_147" href="#Footnote_147"><span class="sp">147</span></a> whose retreat a <i>competent</i>
French general must have converted into an absolute rout;
whilst, had he followed the advice and wishes of Lord Raglan, we
should probably have entered Sebastopol in a fortnight, instead of
having to wait three years for an event which was afterwards accomplished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>308</span>
at a ruinous waste of time, men, <i>materiel</i>, and money.<a name="FnAnchor_148" href="#Footnote_148"><span class="sp">148</span></a> We
had defeated the Russians at Inkerman without French assistance,<a name="FnAnchor_149" href="#Footnote_149"><span class="sp">149</span></a>
whilst the timidity and professional jealousy on that occasion of
Marshal Canrobert had again failed to turn <i>our</i> success into a
crushing disaster for the enemy.<a name="FnAnchor_150" href="#Footnote_150"><span class="sp">150</span></a> If England was dissatisfied,
Russia was still more discontented, and her strength moreover at
this time well-nigh exhausted. Efforts in the direction of peace
were being made by Austria, which are referred to in the cartoon,
<i>Staying Proceedings</i> (vol. xxx.), wherein plaintiff John Bull instructs
his solicitor Clarendon (who is setting off for Paris bag in hand),
&ldquo;Tell Russia,&rdquo; says angry John, &ldquo;tell Russia if he doesn&rsquo;t settle at
once I shall go on with the action;&rdquo; but so unprofitable to us in the
end was the arrangement effected by the solicitor, that the action
was settled after all on the terms of each party having to pay their
own costs. This preposterous result is referred to in the admirable
sketch entitled <i>Swindling the Clarendon</i>, wherein landlord Bull
angrily expostulates with his two waiters (Louis Napoleon and Palmerston),
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; says John, &ldquo;<i>quite the gentleman</i>! Why he has
left nothing but a portmantel of bricks and stones, and gone off
without paying the bill.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_151" href="#Footnote_151"><span class="sp">151</span></a></p>

<p>Just complaints were made in the papers of 1857 of the arrangements,
or rather want of arrangements, at the Royal <i>levées</i>. The
space was circumscribed and the crush frightful, and ladies returned
from the ceremony with torn dresses and dishevelled hair, just as if
they had been engaged in some feminine battle-royal. To accustom
them to this uncomfortable but apparently inevitable ordeal, John
Leech, in one of the very best of his sketches (vol. xxxii.), suggested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>309</span>
a <i>Training School for Ladies about to Appear at Court</i>, where we see
charming women in court dresses leaping over forms, crowding
beneath barriers, and going through a vigorous course of saltatory
exercises, to prepare them for what they might expect at the ceremony;
the floor is strewn with broken fans, gloves, feathers, watches,
and jewellery; while one fat old lady, who, in attempting to scramble
beneath the barrier has become a permanent fixture, presents a truly
comical appearance.</p>

<p>The war was at an end; the &ldquo;Eastern Question,&rdquo; as it was called
<span class="sn">The English Dissatisfied.</span>
in the political jargon of that day, had been settled for the next
twenty years, and John Bull had now leisure to sit down to count
the cost, and consider the value of the French alliance, and the
quality of the assistance he had derived from French generalship and
the French army. The result of John&rsquo;s calculation was eminently
unsatisfactory to himself, for he felt that while he had done all the
hard work and nearly all the fighting, the French, as might have
been expected, had arrogated to themselves all the praise. John in
his secret heart was angry; he felt he had been drawn into a contest
from which he personally derived little advantage, and from which
he emerged nominally triumphant at a ruinous waste of men and
money; the Frenchman, on his part, was doubtful of the reality of
the <i>gloire</i> he claimed for himself, and distinctly conscious, moreover,
that the English soldiers looked coldly on the French army and its
achievements.<a name="FnAnchor_152" href="#Footnote_152"><span class="sp">152</span></a> The result was a feeling of secret dissatisfaction on
both sides, which found, however, no actual expression until an unexpected
circumstance afforded opportunity for its manifestation.
The war had been succeeded by a period of inaction, a state of
things always dreaded by Louis, who was now harassed by plots
and conspiracies, and a certain foreigner connected, or supposed to
be connected, with one of these had sought and found an asylum on
our shores. Certain valorous French colonels, desirous of displaying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>310</span>
their loyalty at a cheap cost, presented an address to his Majesty,
which contained the following intemperate passage:&mdash;&ldquo;Let the
miserable assassins&mdash;the subaltern agents of such crimes&mdash;receive the
chastisement due to their abominable attempts; but also, let the
<i>infamous haunt</i> where machinations so infernal are planned <i>be destroyed
for ever</i>.... Give us the order, sire, and we shall
pursue them even to their places of security.&rdquo; French military composition,
even in the time of the first Napoleon, was never of the
highest order of merit, and the third Napoleon, whose policy it was
to distract the attention of his people from reflecting on the questionable
means by which he had attained his position, never lost an
opportunity of earning popularity with any class of his subjects, particularly
with the army. He suffered this quintessence of bombastic
absurdity to appear in the pages of the official <i>Moniteur</i>, whence it
was duly copied by the English newspapers, and afforded us the
most intense amusement. <i>Punch</i> answered this valorous appeal
with Leech&rsquo;s celebrated cartoon (in vol. xxxiv.) of <i>Cock-a-doodle-do!</i>
wherein the French cock, habited in the uniform of a French colonel,
crows most lustily on his own dunghill. This remarkable caricature
possesses a singular historical interest, as it exactly expresses the
feeling which pervaded England for some time after the close of
the Crimean war. The hostile spirit towards Frenchmen which
formed a part of John Leech&rsquo;s nature, once aroused was not easily
allayed, and in the same volume he gives us specimens of <i>Some
Foreign Produce that Mr. Bull can very well Spare</i>, in which he
angrily includes French conspirators, vile French women, organ
grinders (the artist&rsquo;s peculiar abomination), and other foreign refuse
of an objectionable character. Further on, he follows up the subject
in <i>A Discussion Forum (!) as Imagined by our Volatile Friends</i>, which
represents a party of English conspirators from a French point of
view. They wear the peaked hats, long cravats, long hair, boots,
and inexpressibles peculiar to the Reign of Terror, and carry
knives, revolvers, axes, and other weapons of destruction; a speaker
occupies the rostrum, and below him sits the registrar with a bowl
of blood, in which sanguinary fluid the proceedings are supposed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>311</span>
be recorded. The opposite picture, <i>A Discussion Forum (!) as it is
in Reality</i>, shows us a number of foolish, ignorant, harmless youths,
smoking pipes, drinking brandy and water, and discussing politics
(so far as they are capable of understanding them) in a tavern
club-room. Returning once more to his attacks on what he justly
deemed the Romanizing tendency of the practices of certain members
of the English Church, he gives us the cartoon of <i>Religion à la
Mode</i>, in which a handsome woman is about to &ldquo;confess&rdquo; to a truculent
and knavish looking ritualist. In the distance appears John
Bull with his horsewhip, &ldquo;No, no, Mr. Jack Priest,&rdquo; says he; &ldquo;after
all I have gone through, I am not such a fool as to stand any of
<i>this</i> disgusting nonsense.&rdquo; Some sensation was created this year by
a private fête which was given by a member of the aristocracy at
Cremorne Gardens. It occasioned considerable talk at the time,
and as Ritualism was then in the ascendant amongst certain female
leaders of fashion, Leech gives us (in vol. xxxv.) a powerful picture,
entitled <i>Aristocratic Amusements</i>, in which John Thomas asks his
mistress (a magnificent specimen of the artist&rsquo;s handsome women)
as he puts up the steps of her carriage, whither she would wish to be
driven,&mdash;&ldquo;Confession or Cremorne, my lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Misfortune, the proverb tells us, makes us acquainted with strange
associates. The Emperor Louis, during his early exile, had picked
up certain undesirable acquaintances, who were in the habit in after
life of forcing themselves on his notice after a peculiarly disagreeable
and dangerous fashion. His unfaithfulness to the principles of the
brotherhood of which he and they had been members, had seriously
exercised the minds of certain of these quondam acquaintances,
who had given forcible expression to their feelings by attempting
his assassination. The pear-shaped hand grenades of Orsini and his
fellow-conspirator were the fruit of Louis&rsquo;s early connection with
the secret societies of the Carbonari. They indicate the forces
which controlled the policy of the Third Napoleon, and obliged
him constantly to pick quarrels with his neighbours for the double
purpose of employing his army and of keeping the attention of
his restless subjects and quondam acquaintances distracted from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>312</span>
himself. As the advisers upon whom he depended were removed
by death, the absence of military capacity which his habitual reticence
had concealed was manifested by his extraordinary ignorance
of the weakness of the force which he had at his disposal, and
the utter rottenness of its organization. Meanwhile Italian assassins
warned Louis&rsquo;s advisers of the desperate insecurity of the tenure
by which they held their own position, and of the necessity of
distracting the attention of the restless spirits who made it their
business to inquire into their master&rsquo;s title. Within a year, therefore,
of the execution of Orsini and his friend, a quarrel was
fastened on the Austrian ambassador, which reminded us of the
first Emperor&rsquo;s insult to our own Lord Whitworth, and the Imperial
word went forth that Italy was to be freed &ldquo;from the Alps to the
Adriatic.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_153" href="#Footnote_153"><span class="sp">153</span></a> Although Louis was unable to accomplish this programme,
he was enabled by great good fortune, the aid of Sardinia,
the execrably bad generalship of the Austrians, and the
military <i>prestige</i> which still attached to the French name, to pave
the way for this result; and Austria was not only humbled, but
had moreover to surrender Venetia to Sardinia. No sooner was
the war over, than Louis was suspected of casting longing eyes
at the territories of his brave little ally,<a name="FnAnchor_154" href="#Footnote_154"><span class="sp">154</span></a> and in <i>A Scene from
the New Pantomime</i>, he figures as clown, holding a revolver in his
hand, with a goose marked &ldquo;Italy&rdquo; in his capacious pocket, assuring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>313</span>
Britannia (a stout elderly woman who looks suspiciously on)
that his intentions were of the most honourable description.</p>

<p>In the sketch entitled <i>The Next Invasion, Landing of the French
(Light Wines), and Discomfiture of Old General Beer</i> (vol. xxxviii.),
we have a pictorial prophecy which has not borne fulfilment. Although
the so-called <i>vin ordinaire</i> made some progress among us for
a time, it was soon discovered that a low class of wine, which the
French themselves would not drink, was being manufactured for the
English market, and that good sound claret remained (as might have
been anticipated) as dear, if not dearer, than ever. The climate and
constitution of John Bull do not enable him to appreciate the merits
of &ldquo;red ink&rdquo; as a table beverage, and in the end old General
Barleycorn rallied and drove the invaders out of the popularity they
had for a time achieved.</p>

<p class="center1" style="letter-spacing: 3em;">******</p>

<p>And here we break off&mdash;for reasons which will be apparent in
our next chapter&mdash;the further consideration of the graphic satires
of the late John Leech. Before passing on to other matters, we
are bound to say that we regard them rather for what they might
have been than for what we actually find them. Had they been
executed with the same materials and under the same conditions
as the graphic satires of Gillray or Cruikshank, or still better, in
the manner in which the sporting pictures to the late Mr. Surtees&rsquo;
novels were produced, we have no hesitation in saying that they
would have distanced anything in the nature of caricature which
had gone before. Unfortunately, the productions of the modern
caricaturist (if, indeed, we may term him one) have no reasonable
chance, it being apparently taken for granted that a modern public
will not invest in caricatures of an expensive character.<a name="FnAnchor_155" href="#Footnote_155"><span class="sp">155</span></a> Moreover,
he has no longer any hand in the completion of his picture,
the wood-block being cut up into segments, each entrusted to a
different hand, and executed with materials with which the older
caricaturists had nothing to do, and under conditions of pressure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>314</span>
and haste to which they were happily strangers. Hence it is, that
while the admirable satires of John Leech enhance the value of
the <i>Punch</i> volumes themselves, taken <i>singly</i>, not only will they
not command a fiftieth part of the price asked and given for the
coloured but inferior productions of an earlier school, but they
are to all intents and purposes valueless. Leech himself has often
been known to say to friends who admired his composition on the
wood block:&mdash;&ldquo;Wait till Saturday, and see how the engraver will
have spoiled it.&rdquo; We will subject the justice of these observations
to a practical test. Let the reader compare an ordinary <i>Punch</i>
cartoon with one of the tinted lithographs issued from the <i>Punch</i>
office during the artist&rsquo;s lifetime under the title of <i>The Rising
Generation</i>, and he cannot fail to be struck with the enormous
advantages possessed by the latter. These last have their price,
and command, by reason of their scarcity, a comparatively high one.</p>

July, 1859; the treaty ceding Savoy and Nice to France was signed 24th March,
and approved by the Sardinian Parliament 29th May, 1860. The French
troops retired from Italy the same month. Garibaldi landed at Marsala 11th
May, 1860, and entered Naples on the 18th of August. The kingdom of Italy
was recognised by Great Britain 31st March, 1861. In 1864 Florence was declared
the capital of Italy. The French troops left Rome in November, 1865.
Venetia was ceded to France by Austria 3rd July, 1866. They retired from the
Quadrilateral in October, 1866; Venice was annexed to Italy the same month;
the Italian troops entered Rome in September, 1870, when Napoleon III. was no
longer able to interpose, and it was incorporated in the Italian kingdom in October.</p>

<p class="noind pt05"><span class="sc">Many</span> of our readers will remember the exhibition at the Egyptian
Hall, in 1862, of John Leech&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sketches in Oil,&rdquo; the subjects being
enlarged reproductions from selected examples of his minor drawings
for <i>Punch</i>. To his friend Mark Lemon is due the credit of
this idea, which was carried out after the following manner:&mdash;The
impression of a block in <i>Punch</i> being first taken on a sheet of india-rubber,
was enlarged by a lithographic process; the copy thus
obtained was transferred to stone, and impressions obtained on a
large sheet of canvas. The result was an outline groundwork, consisting
of his own lines enlarged some eight times the dimensions
of the original drawing, which the artist then proceeded to fill up in
colour. His knowledge of the manipulation of oil colours was,
however, slight, and his first crude attempts were made under the
guidance of his friend Mr. Millais. The first results can scarcely be
said to be satisfactory; a kind of transparent colour was used, which
allowed the coarse lines of the enlargement to be distinctly visible,
and the finished production presented very much the appearance of
an indifferent lithograph slightly tinted. In a short time, however,
he conquered the difficulty; and, instead of allowing the thick, fatty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>316</span>
lines of printer&rsquo;s ink to remain on the canvas, he removed them&mdash;particularly
as regards the outlines of the face and figure&mdash;by means
of turpentine. These outlines he re-drew with his own hand in a
fine and delicate manner, and added a daintiness of finish, particularly
in flesh colour, which greatly enhanced the value and
beauty of the work. He nevertheless experienced some difficulty
in reproducing in these enlargements the delicacy of touch and
exactness which characterized the original drawings, and would
labour all day at a detail&mdash;such as a hand in a certain position&mdash;before
attaining a result which entirely satisfied himself. The
catalogue of this exhibition may be cited in evidence of Leech&rsquo;s
characteristic modesty. &ldquo;These sketches,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;have no claim
to be regarded or tested as finished pictures. It is impossible for
any one to know the fact better than I do. They have no pretensions
to a higher name than that I have given them&mdash;&rsquo;Sketches
in Oil.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Popular and eminently successful as this exhibition proved to be,
it was undeniably rendered more popular and successful by his
staunch friend Thackeray&rsquo;s article in the <i>Times</i> of 21st June, 1862:&mdash;&ldquo;He
is a natural truth-teller,&rdquo; said the humourist, &ldquo;as Hogarth was
before him, and indulges in as many flights of fancy. He speaks
his mind out quite honestly, like a thorough Briton.... He
holds Frenchmen in light esteem. A bloated &lsquo;Mossoo&rsquo; walking in
Leicester Square, with a huge cigar and a little hat, with &lsquo;billard&rsquo;
and &lsquo;estaminet&rsquo; written on his flaccid face, is a favourite study with
him; the unshaven jowl, the waist tied with a string, the boots
which pad the Quadrant pavement, this dingy and disreputable
being exercises a fascination over Mr. Punch&rsquo;s favourite artist. We
trace, too, in his work a prejudice against the Hebrew nation,
against the natives of an island much celebrated for its verdure and
its wrongs; these are lamentable prejudices indeed, but what man
is without his own?&rdquo; Thackeray&rsquo;s kindly article delighted Leech;
he said &ldquo;it was like putting £1,000 in his pocket.&rdquo; The exhibition,
indeed, was so splendid a success that it is said to have brought
in nearly £5,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>317</span></p>

<p>Those who, like ourselves, have found it necessary to examine
the <i>Punch</i> volumes from their commencement in 1841, down to the
31st of December, 1864, cannot fail to be struck by the steady
decrease in the number of cartoons which the artist annually
designed and executed for the periodical. In 1857 the number
contributed was 33; in 1858, 30; in 1859, 21; in 1860, 15, in
1861 the number had fallen as low as 10; while in 1862 it did not
exceed 4.<a name="FnAnchor_156" href="#Footnote_156"><span class="sp">156</span></a> This decrease (which is confined, be it observed, to
the cartoons which he contributed to <i>Punch</i>) was due to failing
health consequent on the strain of incessant production. Of the
coming evil he himself was distinctly cognizant. It is said of him
that Lord Ossington, then Speaker, once met him on the rail, and
expressed to him his hope that he enjoyed in his work some of the
gratification which it afforded to others. His answer was a melancholy
one:&mdash;&ldquo;I seem to myself to be a man who has undertaken
to walk a thousand miles in a thousand hours.&rdquo; It was certainly
not such a reply as one would exactly look for, looking only at
the joyous character of the pictures he executed for <i>Punch</i>. He
complained in 1862&mdash;the year at which we have arrived&mdash;of habitual
weariness and sleeplessness, and was advised to try rest and change
of air. He acted upon the suggestion, and, accompanied by his old
friend Mark Lemon, proceeded in that year on a short tour to Paris,
and from thence to Biarritz. Leech&rsquo;s pencil was not idle on this
holiday, as two of his pictures will testify. The first, <i>A Day at
Biarritz</i>, appears in the Almanack of 1863, and among the figures
he has introduced into this delightful sketch is that of the grave and
saturnine Louis, snapping his fingers in the highest <i>abandon</i> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>318</span>
skipping off with his friend <i>Punch</i> to enjoy his ocean bath. &ldquo;The
other,&rdquo; says Mr. Shirley Brooks, &ldquo;is a very remarkable drawing. It
represents a bull-fight as seen by a decent Christian gentleman, and
for the first time since the &lsquo;brutal fray&rsquo; was invented the cold-blooded
barbarity and stupidity of the show is depicted without any
of the flash and flattery with which it has pleased artists to treat the
atrocious scene. That grim indictment of a nation professing to be
civilized will be a record for many a day after the offence shall have
ceased.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_157" href="#Footnote_157"><span class="sp">157</span></a></p>

<p>Leech returned from this brief visit with no appreciable benefit.
Charles Mackay tells us that he met him and his constant friend,
Thackeray, at Evans&rsquo; supper-rooms in December, 1863. &ldquo;They
both complained of illness, but neither of them looked ill enough
to justify the belief that anything ailed them beyond a temporary
indisposition, such as all of us are subject to. Leech was particularly
despondent, and complained much of the annoyances to which
he was subjected by the organ-grinders of London, and by the
dreadful railway whistles at the stations whenever he left town.
His nerves were evidently in a high state of tension, and I recommended
him, not only as a source of health and amusement, but
of profit, to take a voyage across the Atlantic, and pass six months
in America, where he would escape the organ-grinders, street-music,
and the railway-whistles, and bring back a portfolio filled with
sketches of American and Yankee character. &lsquo;I am afraid,&rsquo; he
replied, &lsquo;that B. &amp; E. [Bradbury &amp; Evans] would not like it.
Besides, I should not like to be absent from <i>Punch</i> for so long a
time.&rsquo; &lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; said Thackeray, &lsquo;B. and E. would highly approve,
provided you sent them sketches. <i>I</i> think it a good idea,
and you might put five thousand pounds in your pocket by the
trip. The Americans have never been truly portrayed, as you
would portray them. The niggers alone would be a little fortune
to you.&rsquo; Leech shook his head dubiously, and I thought mournfully,
and no more was said upon the subject.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_158" href="#Footnote_158"><span class="sp">158</span></a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>319</span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, the end of one at least of these steady friends
and men of genius was drawing near with sure and rapid strides.
Both were present at the anniversary of the death of the founder
of the Charterhouse, &ldquo;good old Thomas Sutton,&rdquo; on the 12th
of that same month of December, 1863. At the celebration of
Divine service at four o&rsquo;clock, Thackeray occupied his accustomed
back seat in the quaint old chapel; from thence he went to the
oration in the Governor&rsquo;s room; and as he walked up to the
orator with his contribution, the great humourist, Mr. Theodore
Taylor, tells us, was received &ldquo;with such hearty applause as only
Carthusians can give to one who has immortalized their school.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_159" href="#Footnote_159"><span class="sp">159</span></a>
At the banquet which followed he sat by the side of John Leech,
who was one of the stewards, and proposed the time-honoured
toast, <i>Floreat Æternum Carthusiana Domus</i>, in a speech which was
received with three times three and one cheer more. John Leech
replied to the toast of the stewards. The day is memorable as
the last &ldquo;Founder&rsquo;s Day,&rdquo; which either of these men&mdash;so eminently
distinguished in art and letters&mdash;was ever permitted to attend.</p>

<p>Three days afterwards Thackeray was present at the usual weekly
<i>Punch</i> dinner on the 15th of December, for, although he had long
ceased to be a regular contributor to the periodical, he not only
continued to aid the staff with his suggestion and advice, but
was a constant member of the council.<a name="FnAnchor_160" href="#Footnote_160"><span class="sp">160</span></a> But ever since the time
he was writing &ldquo;Pendennis,&rdquo; a dozen years before, he had been
visited periodically by attacks of sickness, attended with violent
retching. One of these occurred on the morning of Wednesday,
the 23rd of this same month of December, and he was in great
suffering all day. About midnight of that day, his mother, Mrs.
Carmichael Smith,<a name="FnAnchor_161" href="#Footnote_161"><span class="sp">161</span></a> who slept in the room above his own, had
heard him get up and walk about; but as this was his habit when
visited by these fell visitations, she was not alarmed. The man,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>320</span>
however, was in his mortal agony; and when his valet, Charles
Sargent, entered his master&rsquo;s chamber on the morning of Christmas
Eve, and tried to arouse him, he found that he answered not, neither
regarded, having passed into the slumber from which the spirit of
man refuses to be awakened.</p>

<p>Dying Jerrold had time vouchsafed to him to whisper, &ldquo;Tell the
dear boys,&rdquo; meaning his associates in <i>Punch</i>, &ldquo;that if I have ever
wounded any of them, I&rsquo;ve always loved them,&rdquo; and so he went his
way. To Thackeray no such grace was given; the hands peacefully
spread over the coverlet, which stirred not when Sargent bent anxiously
over his master, proclaimed that true hearted noble Thackeray
had gone the long journey, leaving no word of message for
those who had loved him. &ldquo;We talked of him,&rdquo; said Mr. Edmund
Yates, &ldquo;of how, more than any other author, he had written about
what is said of men immediately after their death&mdash;of how he had
written of the death-chamber, &lsquo;They shall come in here for the last
time to you, my friend in motley.&rsquo; We read that marvellous sermon
which the week-day preacher delivered to entranced thousands over
old John Sedley&rsquo;s dead body, and &lsquo;sadly fell our Christmas Eve.&rsquo;&rdquo;
That same Christmas Eve, the melancholy tidings were conveyed to
Mark Lemon by his sorrowing friend, John Leech. The artist was
terribly affected, and told Millais of his presentiment that he also
should die suddenly and soon.</p>

<p>In March, 1864, we notice the death of another author, whose
almost unrecorded name is, nevertheless, intimately associated with
that of the artist. This was Mr. R. W. Surtees, author of the
sporting novels which the genius of Leech has made for ever famous.
Mr. Surtees for some years practised as a London solicitor; but the
death of an elder brother improved his position, and enabled him to
quit a profession which he disliked, in favour of the more congenial
employment of literature. Those of his works best known (he published
several others) are, of course, &ldquo;Handley Cross,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sponge&rsquo;s
Sporting Tour,&rdquo; &ldquo;Plain or Ringlets,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ask Mamma,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mr. Facey
Romford&rsquo;s Hounds.&rdquo; Notwithstanding a decidedly horsey and somewhat
vulgar tone,&mdash;a tone which by the way certainly did not characterize
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>321</span>
Mr. Surtees himself,&mdash;they possess a certain original humour,
which will render their perusal productive of amusement. He died
suddenly on the 16th of March, 1864, in his sixty-second year.</p>

<p>It has been the habit of the contributors to <i>Punch</i>, almost from
the commencement of the periodical, to dine together every Wednesday.
In the winter months the dinner was usually held in the front
room of the first floor of the business premises of the proprietors,
Messrs. Bradbury &amp; Evans, in Bouverie Street, Whitefriars. Sometimes
these dinners were held at the Bedford Hotel, Covent Garden.
During the summer months it was customary to hold ten or twelve
dinners at Greenwich, Richmond, Blackwall, and other places in the
neighbourhood of London. On these occasions the programme (if we
may so term it) of the forthcoming number was arranged and settled,
papers were brought out, and the latest intelligence discussed, so
as to bring the &ldquo;cartoon&rdquo; down to the latest, or rather one of the
latest subjects of current interest. At the weekly council dinner
John Leech was a faithful attendant. These meetings, indeed, &ldquo;he
thoroughly enjoyed, and his suggestions, not merely as to pictorial
matters, but generally, were among the most valuable that were
offered, as may be inferred from his large knowledge of the world,
his keen sense of the ludicrous, and his hatred of injustice and
cruelty.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_162" href="#Footnote_162"><span class="sp">162</span></a> One of the most regular attendants of the <i>Punch</i> dinners&mdash;I
think that in 1864, at least, he scarcely missed one&mdash;was the
most indefatigable of the literary staff, Mr. Shirley Brooks. One
was held at The Bedford on the 13th of April, 1864, just about the
time when Lord John Russell was setting out as our representative
at the Conference, and the outcome of this particular <i>Punch</i> dinner,
at which were present Messrs. Mark Lemon, Shirley Brooks, Tom
Taylor, John Leech, and Percival Leigh, was Leech&rsquo;s admirable
cartoon of <i>Moses Starting for the Fair</i>. &ldquo;Let us hope,&rdquo; adds the
pictorial satirist, in special reference to his lordship&rsquo;s unfortunate
capacity for getting himself into a mess, that &ldquo;he won&rsquo;t bring back a
gross of green spectacles.&rdquo; It was one of the last of Leech&rsquo;s political
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>322</span>
shafts, and the subject was suggested (we have his own authority for
stating it) by his friend and literary colleague, Mr. Shirley Brooks.<a name="FnAnchor_163" href="#Footnote_163"><span class="sp">163</span></a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Clearly ill,&rdquo; is Mr. Brook&rsquo;s record of the state of John Leech&rsquo;s
health on this same 13th of April, 1864. He no longer found
pleasure in hunting, of which he had been exceedingly fond, and
had even discontinued, at the order of his medical attendant, riding
on horseback. He was affected with nervous irritability, the effect
of incessant application. The ordinary noise of the streets&mdash;musicians,
organ-grinders, street vendors, and the like&mdash;worried him beyond
endurance. Long before the period at which we have arrived
these annoyances had driven him from his residence in Brunswick
Square to seek shelter from his enemies at No. 3, The Terrace,
Kensington. His nervous irritability is manifested in the designs
which he continued to draw for <i>Punch</i>. In one of his illustrations
to vol. xlv. (1863), depicting certain familiar sea-side nuisances, he
asks, &ldquo;Why a couple of conceited fanatics should be allowed to
disturb the repose of a Sunday afternoon by the sea-side?&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Why the authorities at Brighton, so sensible and considerate in
keeping the place free from the <i>detestable</i> organ grinders, should
permit the terrible nuisance indicated [in the illustration] to exist?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Fresh prawns, whiting, oysters, or watercresses,&rdquo; remonstrated the
persecuted artist, &ldquo;are capital things in their way, and we should
think that the jaded man of occupation, or the invalid, would very
much rather send to a respectable shop for such delicacies, than
have them &lsquo;bellowed&rsquo; into his ears morning, noon, and night.&rdquo;
His illustrations of this character are so numerous that the ordinary
observer would probably suppose that they were part only of a
series; to the observer, however, who knew Leech, they clearly
indicate the nervous irritability under which he suffered, and which
was probably caused, and certainly intensified, by the nuisances of
which he complained.</p>

<p>The state of Leech&rsquo;s health in May, 1864, seems to me best explained
in the letter which Mark Lemon at this time wrote to Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>323</span>
Bass, in relation to his proposed bill for the regulation of street
music. After showing how he himself was obliged to quit London
to escape the nuisance of street music, the then editor of <i>Punch</i>
continues: &ldquo;A dear friend of mine, and one to whom the public
has been indebted for more than twenty years for weekly supplies of
innocent amusement, and whose name will find a place in the future
history of art, has not been so fortunate. He lived in Brunswick
Square, and remained there until the nervous system was so seriously
affected by the continual disturbance to which he was subjected
while at work, that he was compelled to abandon a most desirable
home, and seek a retreat at Kensington. After expending considerable
sums to make his residence convenient for his art-work,&mdash;placing
double windows to the front of his house, etc.,&mdash;he is
again driven from his home by the continual visitation of street
bands and organ-grinders. The effect upon his health&mdash;produced,
upon my honour, by the causes I have named&mdash;is so serious that
he is forbidden to take horse exercise, or indulge in fast walking,
as a palpitation of the heart has been produced&mdash;a form of <i>angina
pectoris</i>, I believe&mdash;and his friends are most anxiously concerned
for his safety. He is ordered to Homburg, and I know that the
expatriation will entail a loss of nearly £50 a week upon him just at
present.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I need not withhold from you the name of this poor
gentleman. It is Mr. John Leech.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If those gentlemen who laugh at complaints such as this letter
contains were to know what are the natural penalties of constant
brain-work, they would not encourage or defend such unnecessary
inflictions as street music entails upon some of the benefactors of
their age. Such men are the last to interfere with the enjoyments of
their poorer fellow-labourers; but they claim to be allowed to pursue
their callings in peace, and to have the comfort of their homes
secured to them. All they wish is to have the same immunity
from the annoyances of street music as the rest of the community
have from dustmen&rsquo;s bells, post-horns, and other unnecessary disturbances.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>324</span></p>

<p>The terrible nature of poor Leech&rsquo;s sufferings will be shown by
another anecdote of Dr. Mackay&rsquo;s. Just about this time he met
Mr. F. M. Evans, one of the proprietors of <i>Punch</i>, and asked him
how Leech was. &ldquo;Very ill,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;the sufferings he
endures from noise are painful to think of. I took him down into
the country a little while ago to stay a week, or as much longer as
he pleased, promising him that he should hear no organ-grinders
there, nor railway whistles, nor firing of guns. The next morning
on getting up to breakfast, I found that he had packed up his portmanteau
and was ready to depart. &lsquo;I cannot stay any longer here,&rsquo;
he said, &lsquo;the noise drives me frantic!&rsquo; &lsquo;What noise?&rsquo; &lsquo;The gardener
whetting his scythe. It goes through my ears like a corkscrew.&rsquo;
And nothing that I could say could prevail upon him to
prolong his visit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there was no falling off in the quality of the work which
Leech executed for <i>Punch</i> or other employers at this time; on the
contrary, his drawings seemed to me marked by more than their
usual excellence. Witness more especially the few etchings he lived
to finish for &ldquo;Mr. Facey Romford&rsquo;s Hounds,&rdquo; and the coloured etching
to &ldquo;Punch&rsquo;s Pocket Book&rdquo; of the year. One of the illustrations
which he designed for the 1864 edition of the &ldquo;Ingoldsby Legends,&rdquo;
and which shows us one of his stalwart servant girls drawing up
the trunkless head of &ldquo;St. Genulphus&rdquo; from the bottom of the well,
appears to me to call for special notice. I would ask the reader to
observe the details of that perfectly marvellous drawing, executed
with all the effect and at a fifth of the labour which George Cruikshank
in his best days would have bestowed upon it. I would
entreat him to mark that wicked, graceless, bald-pated old head,
with its port wine nose resting on the rim of the bucket, and its
wicked old eye suggestively winking unutterable things at the perplexed
and astounded maiden. I would ask him to look at that
drawing; to take into account the health of the genial, failing artist
who designed it; and to tell me, whether in all the range of English
comic art he remembers to have met with anything more intensely
comical?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>325</span></p>

<p>We find John Leech and his able coadjutor, Mr. John Tenniel,
present at the <i>Punch</i> dinner of Wednesday, the 15th of June; but
shortly afterwards he started on the journey ordered by his medical
advisers, and set off for Homburg in the company of his friend,
Mr. Alfred Elmore, sojourning afterwards for a time at Schwalbach.
He was absent altogether about six weeks. A record in the diary to
which I am indebted for so much information in relation to him
tells me, under date of 10th August, &ldquo;Leech has returned from
Germany, but I am sorry to say I don&rsquo;t think he is stronger.&rdquo; The
sole result, in fact, obtained was that his mind was amused by his
visit to new scenery, while his sketch-book was filled with valuable
memorials of the sojourn for future use. He was present at the
<i>Punch</i> dinner on Wednesday, the 17th of August, and suggested
to his colleagues by way of cartoon the subject of <i>The American
Juggernaut</i>.</p>

<p>Just at the time when Leech came back from Germany, unbenefited
<span class="sn">The Death of Robson.</span>
by the change which it was hoped would recruit his
exhausted strength, a great artist in another and a different walk in
art, one who had not used his <i>genius</i> (we will not say his opportunities,
for we doubt whether they were really given him) to the
best advantage, took his departure from the scene of many triumphs
and greater disappointments: this was Thomas Frederick Robson, the
actor. He had been so long absent from the boards, that the event
failed to create the sensation which might have been expected from
the sudden fall of a theatrical star of such unquestionable magnitude.
Full justice has been done to his remarkable genius elsewhere; and
all united in regret that a man who was so great an artist, and
might have been a greater, had been prematurely lost to the
theatrical world. Those who remember Robson and his marvellous
powers,&mdash;the lightning-like flashes of energy he was wont to throw
into his parts,&mdash;his startling transition from passion to passion,&mdash;will
agree with us that, if circumstances had led him to study the higher
drama, his name would probably have occupied a place side by side
with the more prominent names of George Frederick Cooke, Edmund
Kean, and our own Irving.  The remarkable power wasted on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>326</span>
burlesque, or thrown away in the delineation of low life character,
must assuredly have made itself felt in tragedy; and the <i>genius</i>
manifested in the <i>mock</i> Shylock of Robson, would have enabled him
to offer a splendid presentment of the real Hebrew, and as perfect
a realization of the character of Richard the Third as has ever
perhaps been seen. His comedy&mdash;when opportunity was given
him of displaying it&mdash;was full of true humour. He had in fact, in
a remarkable degree, all the qualities of a splendid actor; but it
was his peculiar misfortune that he had never a proper opportunity
given him of displaying them. The fact that he was enormously
popular was nothing, for many men are popular with not a tithe of
the gifts or power which distinguished Robson. The favour of the
&ldquo;general,&rdquo; except in a sordid sense, is not worth much in these days.
A proof of this is to be found in the fact that the name of Robson&mdash;after
the lapse of twenty years&mdash;is scarcely known to the ordinary
playgoer; but his genius, while he lived, was recognised by those
whose applause is not easily earned, and was therefore worth the
earning.</p>

<p>Within a week or ten days after his return from the Continent,
Leech went with his family to Whitby, in the hope that the fresh
Yorkshire sea air would invigorate and brace up his shattered
system. Some friends were staying there at the time, and among
them a young artist then comparatively new to <i>Punch</i>, but who has
been for years past one of its leading pictorial supporters<a name="FnAnchor_164" href="#Footnote_164"><span class="sp">164</span></a>&mdash;Mr.
Du Maurier. During his sojourn here, I find him writing to his
friends the Brookses, that if they would join him, it would induce
him to prolong his stay. They went accordingly, and remained at
Whitby until the artist returned to town on the 3rd of October.
&ldquo;Leech, when we could induce him to leave the painting in oil, to
which he devoted too many hours, enjoyed the drives into the wild
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>327</span>
moors, and up and down the terrible but picturesque roads; and he
was still more delighted with the rich woods, deep glades, and
glorious views about Mulgrave Castle. I hoped,&rdquo; continues Shirley
Brooks, in the touching memorial which he contributed to the
<i>Illustrated London News</i> only a few weeks afterwards, &ldquo;I hoped that
good was being done; but it was very hard to stir him from his
pictures, of which he declared that he must finish a great number by
Christmas. It was not for want of earnest and affectionate remonstrance
of those close by his side, nor lack of such remonstrance
being seconded by myself and others, that he persevered in overlabour
at these paintings, which he had undertaken with his usual
generosity, in order to enable himself to provide a very large sum of
money for the benefit of his relatives, not of his own household. It
need hardly be said that he was never pressed for work by his old
friend the editor of <i>Punch</i>.&rdquo; For a long time past his contribution
to that periodical had not exceeded one half-page engraving each
week; but at Whitby he elaborated a large sketch, originally taken
at Schwalbach, which is worthy of mention as being the last of his
cartoons. It will be found in vol. xlvii. (1864), and is labelled <i>The
Weinbrunnen Schwalbach</i>, and among the company drinking the
waters he has introduced the late Emperor Louis, the late King of
Italy, the late Pope, and other notable political personages. The
light esteem in which he held everything French is notable in this
drawing. Conspicuous in the foreground are several dogs belonging
to the English turnspit breed, one of which views a yapping French
poodle with the most unmitigated disdain. The landscape and
surroundings in this composition deserve particular attention, as
they are charming examples of Leech&rsquo;s oft-admitted talent as a
landscape artist.</p>

<p>In the diary I find several reminiscences of the Whitby visit, and
of the walks and drives and dinners with the Leeches. Shirley
Brooks and his wife drove with them to Mulgrave Castle and its
&ldquo;glorious woods,&rdquo; on the 29th of September; the former afterwards
went to a concert at St. Hilda&rsquo;s Hall, in reference to which I find
the following entry:&mdash;&ldquo;Grisi, Mario, Sainton and his wife. I wrote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>328</span>
to the latter, and went round to see them between the parts. Introduced
to Grisi, who was in a vile temper, something about rooms.&rdquo;
Shirley Brooks sent also the following characteristic account of the
entertainment to the <i>Musical World</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pt2 sc">&ldquo;My dear Sir,&mdash;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 4em;">&ldquo;Owls, like other quadrupeds, must have holidays, and
I have flown hither. But the wind has changed, and the owl, for
all his feathers, is a-cold, as the poet observes. I shall return to the
Metropolis&mdash;<i>templa quam dilecta</i>&mdash;as Plautus might have said in his
<i>Owlowlaria</i>, if he had liked. I never thought much of these Latin
dramatists, and indeed I never would read any of their works. For
that matter, the works of few dramatists are worth reading. And
while on the subject, I may add, that few writings of any kind are
worth reading. Herein I am at one with Thomas Carlyle, and show
my admiration of what he says by absolutely declining to read his
&rsquo;Frederick the Great.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly I might not have expended the postage stamp affixed
to this letter had I intended only to offer you the above interesting
information. I could have given you this at the Keppell&rsquo;s Arms
during one of those many refections which I hope to partake with
you at that hostelry. But I wish to record something that may have
an immediate interest. There is a hall here called St. Hilda&rsquo;s Hall,
and it is used for public purposes. It is furnished with a large scene-like
painting of Whitby, is very hot, and is near the harbour, which at
low tide emitteth odours which are odious; and I think that it is
always low tide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a concert in this hall in the afternoon, and also in the
evening, of the Feast of S. Michael and All Angels. Two of the
latter came here to sing. You know them in London as Madame
Grisi and Madame Sainton-Dolby. With them came Signor Mario
and M. Sainton, and also Herr M. Lutz and Mr. Patey. They all
sang or played. Verily, my friend and pitcher (for thou pitchest
stones deftly, as it were), it was a refreshment, yea, and a consolation,
to hear their voices and their instruments. I will not give you a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id="page329"></a>329</span>
catalogue of their musical deeds, for I had a bill, but it was borrowed
from me by a large Yorkshireman, and he was so very large that I
did not like to demand it again. Nevertheless, <i>La Diva</i> sang &ldquo;The
Last Rose of Summer,&rdquo; <i>a la Flotow</i>, and made me think of many
things&mdash;are they not written in the book of the Chronicles of
Benjamin, whose name is Lumley? Likewise she sang something
out of <i>Faust</i>, with il Signor, and other matters, whereof no matter&mdash;is
it not enough to have seen and heard her? But commend me,
(not that I need your commendation) to Madame Sainton-Dolby,
inasmuch as that lady sang Handel&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lascia ch&rsquo;o pianga,&rsquo; and sang
it nobly, and sang Smart&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lady of the Lea,&rsquo; and sang
Claribel&rsquo;s &lsquo;Maggie&rsquo;s Secret,&rsquo; and sang it divinely. You know what
M. Sainton can do with his violin, but you do not know what he
cannot do with it, nor do I. Il Signor Mario put forth his powers
chivalrously, and broke many hearts among the fair York roses. <i>La
Diva</i> was dressed in white. Madame Sainton-Dolby was dressed in
pink. I was dressed in a black coat, waistcoat, and trowsers, white
cravat, lavender gloves, and patent leather boots, and the little boys
of Whitby, unaccustomed to such splendour, cheered me as I came
out, privately and alone, to dip my beak in the gascon wine, that is,
in some excellent beer, in which I now drink your health.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you have another reporter, your own special, in the town (I
saw two or three persons who looked disreputable and enthusiastic
enough to be musical critics&mdash;or even dustmen), and he has kept
sober and sent you a report, you need not print this. I do not care
a horse&rsquo;s mamma whether you print it or not. But I had a delightful
evening, and I do not care who knows it; in fact, I wish everybody
to know it, and that is why I write to your widely circulated (and
widely yawned-over) journal. You have not been over civil to me
of late, which is very ungrateful. You may say, with an attempt at
wit, that the owl was a baker&rsquo;s child, and therefore crusty. I
believe that you could win the prize for the worst conundrum in any
circus in Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Receive the assurance of my profound respect.</p>

<p class="rt" style="padding-right: 5em;">&ldquo;Ever yours,</p>
<p class="sc">&ldquo;Whitby.</p>
<p class="rt sc">&ldquo;Zamiel&rsquo;s Owl.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>330</span></p>

<p class="pt2">While at <span class="correction" title="amended from Whity">Whitby</span>, a deputation from the Institute of that town
waited on John Leech, to ask him to attend at a meeting and speak
in promotion of the interests of their association. On that day he
happened to be too ill to bear an interview with more than one of
the gentlemen who composed the deputation, and was obliged in
consequence to refuse the request. But the refusal gave the kindly,
failing man serious disquietude, and fearing it might be thought
ungracious, he forthwith sent for all his sketches of character from
London and presented them to the Institute.</p>

<p>Fechter was the leading dramatic star of that time, and his
opening night differed from the commencement of other theatrical
seasons in the fact that it invariably attracted together some of
the best known men in literature and art. At the opening of the
Lyceum on Saturday, the 22nd of October, were present Messrs.
Charles Dickens, Shirley Brooks, Hollingshead, Oxenford, Horace
Mayhew, Edmund Yates, W. P. Frith, R.A., Creswick, R.A., Marcus
Stone, Mr. Burnand (the present editor of <i>Punch</i>), and Serjeant
Ballantine. &ldquo;The new piece,&rdquo; said Mr. Yates, &ldquo;was splendidly
mounted, and never, even in Paris, have I seen Mr. Fechter play
so perfectly.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_165" href="#Footnote_165"><span class="sp">165</span></a> The said piece was called &ldquo;The King&rsquo;s Butterfly,&rdquo;
and Mr. Brooks says of it that, barring the &ldquo;splendid scenery,&rdquo; it
was &ldquo;rubbish&rdquo; pure and simple.</p>

<p>The Leeches left Whitby on the 3rd of October, breaking their
journey at York. The artist seemed somewhat better, and ten days
after their return we find them at a party at the house of Mr.
W. P. Frith, R.A., among the company being Messrs. Elmore,
Creswick, Yates, George Cruikshank, Solomon Hart, and others.
Between the date of this party, on Thursday the 13th, and that
of the usual <i>Punch</i> dinner, on Wednesday the 26th of October,
at which the artist was present, a visible change had, however,
taken place in the appearance of John Leech. Shirley Brooks
afterwards had occasion to notice that at this <i>Punch</i> dinner he
&ldquo;complained of illness and pain, and I saw that it was difficult to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>331</span>
make him completely grasp the meaning of things that were said
to him without two or three repetitions. He left early with Tom
Taylor.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_166" href="#Footnote_166"><span class="sp">166</span></a> On the 28th of October, the artist himself was conscious
that something was wrong. He visited Dr. Quain, who
assured him that his only chance lay in complete and entire rest;
and, on returning home, he wrote a note in pencil addressed to his
old friend, Mr. Frederick Evans, in which he mentioned his interview
with the medical man, and added that he hoped to complete
a cut for which a messenger was to be sent, but that he was not sure
of being able to finish it. A messenger was sent in obedience to
his desire, but he returned empty-handed. We return at this point
to the diary of Mr. Shirley Brooks. &ldquo;I called,&rdquo; he says (29th of
October), &ldquo;at 27, Bouverie Street, and heard from Evans that he
was very ill. We went off to the Terrace, Kensington. He was
in bed, but no one seemed frightened, and there was a child&rsquo;s party&mdash;a
small one. Mrs. Leech was in tears, but certainly had no reason
to apprehend the worst. He would have seen us. We remained
three-quarters of an hour or so, but an opiate had been given, so
it was of course felt that he ought not to be disturbed. Arranged
to meet Evans at three next day;&rdquo; but the fatal messenger, who
will call for each and every of us, had already delivered his summons,
and never more (in life) were either of the friends fated to
see John Leech again. &ldquo;At seven o&rsquo;clock that night,&rdquo; continues
the narrator (in another place<a name="FnAnchor_167" href="#Footnote_167"><span class="sp">167</span></a>), &ldquo;it pleased God to release him
from sufferings so severe as even to make the brave, patient, enduring
man say that they were almost more than he could bear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Evans called on Brooks the following day (Sunday, 30th
October). &ldquo;After hearing all he could say, I went with him to
telegraph to Mark Lemon, and also to Leech&rsquo;s. Millais and Leigh
at the door&mdash;heard much from them. Mrs. Chester came up&mdash;Charles
Eaton, Mrs. Leech&rsquo;s brother and best friend, had come. We
went in and saw him ... and the poor mother, and two of
the sisters, and afterwards to the chamber of death. He looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>332</span>
noble in his calm; the hair and whiskers put back, gave up his fine
forehead and handsome features&mdash;and the eternal stillness gave his
face an elevated expression. I looked a very long time on my old
friend&rsquo;s face. We have known one another many years, and he has
been engaged with me in business as well as in pleasure. He was
very kind&mdash;very good&mdash;and is in heaven, whatever that means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>London was, perhaps, more shocked at the sudden and unexpected
death of John Leech than even when Thackeray was
smitten. The shock radiated all over the country; for there was not
a household in the land in which his name was not familiar as a
household word. His personal friends were deeply affected&mdash;none
more so than his attached friend, Charles Dickens. Writing at the
time to Forster, in reference to his coming book, &ldquo;Our Mutual
Friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have not done my number. This death of
poor Leech (I suppose) has put me out woefully. Yesterday, and
the day before, I could do nothing; seemed, for the time being,
to have quite lost the power; and am only by slow degrees
getting back into the track to day.&rdquo; Mr. John Tenniel heard of the
loss of his valued <i>confrère</i> that same Sunday, 30th October, and
&ldquo;was stunned at the news, totally unexpected by him.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_168" href="#Footnote_168"><span class="sp">168</span></a> A special
meeting of the <i>Punch</i> staff was called by Mark Lemon on the
following day; himself, Messrs. Percival Leigh, Shirley Brooks, F.
C. Burnand, Tom Taylor, Charles Keene, H. Silver, John Tenniel,&mdash;all
were present with the exception of Horace Mayhew. With
the particulars of that meeting we of course have nothing to do;
its melancholy character the reader may well imagine.</p>

<p>On Friday, the 4th of November, 1864, they laid John Leech to
rest in Kensal Green Cemetery, &ldquo;in the next grave but one to W[illiam]
M[akepeace] T[hackeray]. When Annie Thackeray heard of
the death, she [had] said to Mrs. Millais, &lsquo;How glad my father will
be to meet him!&rsquo; &lsquo;And he will,&rsquo;&rdquo; adds the friend whose note we
have transcribed.<a name="FnAnchor_169" href="#Footnote_169"><span class="sp">169</span></a> We take the account of his burial from Mr.
Edmund Yates&rsquo;s impressive and touching account in the <i>Morning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>333</span>
Star</i> newspaper. &ldquo;The scene round the grave was a most impressive
one. There, ranged round the coffin, stood the remnant of
that famous body of wits who had caused the name of <i>Punch</i> to be
famous at the ends of the earth; there, in the coffin, lay all that was
earthly of him who, more than any of them, had helped to spread its
renown, and to win for himself a name familiar as a household word
in all our English homes. By its side stood Mark Lemon, who, for
two and twenty years has presided over the weekly dinner where the
good things are suggested, and the weekly sheet whereon they are
inscribed; who has seen comrades fall out of the ranks in the march
of life, and perish by the wayside. And such comrades! Gone
the brilliant, meteoric A&rsquo;Beckett; fiery, impulsive, scathing Jerrold;
playfully cynical Thackeray; and now&mdash;<i>John Leech</i>! There stood
Shirley Brooks, who since Jerrold&rsquo;s death has been <i>Punch&rsquo;s</i> literary
mainstay; Tom Taylor, working now in other channels, but still
attached to the staff; Horace Mayhew and Percival Leigh, old
colleagues of the dead man; F. C. Burnand and H. Silver, the
youngest of the corps; and John Tenniel, who had taken Mr.
Doyle&rsquo;s place on his secession, and worked in thorough amity with
Leech. Over the coffin bowed the handsome head of Millais in
overwhelming grief. All round one caught glimpses of well-known
people. There, in the front rank of the crowd, was the frank, earnest
face of Charles Dickens; by him Alexander Munro, the sculptor;
there a group of artists&mdash;Messrs. Creswick, O&rsquo;Neil, and Elmore;<a name="FnAnchor_170" href="#Footnote_170"><span class="sp">170</span></a>
Messrs. Mowbray, Morris, Dallas, and W. H. Russell, of the <i>Times</i>.
At the back of the grave, by the canopy, Mr. W. P. Frith, R.A.;
near him a group of journalists&mdash;Messrs. Friswell, Halliday, Gruneison;
Mr. Swain, the engraver, who had had for years the engraving
of Mr. Leech&rsquo;s drawings; Richard Doyle; Mr. Orridge, the barrister;
the Rev. C. Currey, preacher of the Charter House;
Lieutenant-Colonel Wilkinson, who had had John Leech for his
school-fellow and fag at Charter House; while amateur art was
worthily represented by Messrs. Arthur Lewis, M. F. Halliday, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>334</span>
Jopling. And there, in the bright autumn sunshine, they laid him
to his rest. Sir T. N. Talfourd relates that at the burial of Charles
Lamb, &lsquo;the true-hearted son of Admiral Burney refused to be comforted.&rsquo;
It is our task to record that round the grave of John Leech
there was not a dry eye, and that some of his old companions were
very painfully affected. The most beautiful part of the service was
read by Mr. Hole,<a name="FnAnchor_171" href="#Footnote_171"><span class="sp">171</span></a> in an earnest manner, broken occasionally by

here and there among the crowd loud sobs told of hearty though
humble mourners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the 12th of November, 1864, there appeared in the pages of
the periodical he had so well served, whose pages he has permanently
enriched with some of the choicest specimens of graphic
satire, and with whose fortunes he had been associated from the
commencement, the following touching notice from the pen of his
friend, the late Shirley Brooks:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pt2">&ldquo;The simplest words are best where all words are vain. Ten
days ago a great artist, in the noon of life, and with his glorious
mental faculties in full power, but with the shade of physical infirmity
darkening upon him, took his accustomed place among friends
who have this day held his pall. Some of them had been fellow-workers
with him for a quarter of a century, others for fewer years;
but to know him well was to love him dearly, and all in whose name
these lines are written mourn as for a brother. His monument is in
the volumes of which this is one sad leaf, and in a hundred works
which at this hour few will remember more easily than those who
have just left his grave. While society, whose every phase he has

to satiric art, gladly and proudly takes charge of his fame,
they, whose pride in the genius of a great associate was equalled by
their affection for an attached friend, would leave on record that
they have known no kindlier, more refined, or more generous nature
than that of him who has been thus early called to his rest.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI.</h3>

<h5><i>A BOOK ILLUSTRATOR: HABLOT KNIGHT BROWNE.</i></h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">In</span> a work dealing with comic artists and caricaturists, one is somewhat
puzzled to decide what place to assign to the distinguished
draughtsman who died a year and a half ago. <i>Ultimus Romanorum</i>,
the last of the great trio of designers, Cruikshank, Leech, and
Browne, his career offers to us a singular paradox; for although not
born a comic artist (as we shall endeavour presently to show), he
executed a vast number of comic illustrations; and while, so far as
we know, never guilty of a caricature in his life, the larger portion
of his drawings are caricatures pure and simple.</p>

<p>We might cite a hundred examples of this tendency to exaggeration,
but one shall suffice. In the etching wherein Miss Nickleby
is introduced to her uncle&rsquo;s objectionable friends, Miss Nickleby as
well as the &ldquo;friends&rdquo; are remarkable for the largeness of their heads
and the flimsiness of their bodies; while the men, if not exactly like
those described by Pliny, or quoted from him (without acknowledgment)
by our Sir John Mandeville, are at any rate too grotesque
for human beings. If humanity offers to our study in daily life
a variety in form, face, and feature, comprising eccentricities as well
as excellencies, such specimens, nevertheless, as poor Smike or
Mr. Mantalini were never designed in its <i>atelier</i>.</p>

<p>The DEPARTURE.</p>

<p class="ar">[<i>Face p. 336.</i></p></td></tr></table></div>

<p>The artist&rsquo;s invincible tendency to exaggeration, that is <i>caricature</i>
(in the Johnsonian definition of the word), was observed by his
friend and ally, the late Charles James Lever, who remarked with reference
to his illustrations of the novel of &ldquo;Jack Hinton,&rdquo; &ldquo;Browne&rsquo;s
sketches are as usual <i>caricatures</i>; they make my scenes too riotous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>337</span>
and disorderly. The character of my books for uproarious people
and incident I owe mainly to Master Phiz.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_172" href="#Footnote_172"><span class="sp">172</span></a> When Samuel Lover
was sent over to Brussels by McGlashan, the publisher, to take a
likeness of the novelist, he was accompanied by Browne, the object
of whose visit was to confer with the author on the subject of these
very illustrations. Lever was so anxious to restrain him from
caricaturing his countrymen, that he even begged Browne to accompany
him to Dublin for the purpose of seeing the <i>natives</i>, instead of
the wretched specimens of Milesian humanity to be met with in
London.</p>

<p>Another fault of this artist, which will be apparent to any one
<span class="sn">Lack of Vitality.</span>
acquainted with his work, is the weakness of his outline, and the
singular absence of solidity, stability, and even of <i>vitality</i> in his
figures. There is no lack of powerful situations in Frank Smedley&rsquo;s
novel of &ldquo;Lewis Arundel,&rdquo; but Browne&rsquo;s illustrations are characterised
by an utter absence of vitality, while shadow usurps the place
of substantial bone and muscle. There are the usual thread-paper
men in tail hats, with trousers so tightly strapped to their feet that
they must go through the tedium of existence in intolerable discomfort.
In one picture he shows us a fragile, attenuated man holding
another fragile, attenuated man over the well of a staircase by the
waistband of his trousers, a feat which, difficult of performance to
a Hercules, would be absolutely beyond the power of a person so
fragile, so absolutely destitute of bone and muscle, as the hero of
this particular episode.</p>

<p>The weakness of which we now speak becomes strikingly
apparent when he enables us to compare him with either of the
distinguished trio to which he himself belonged. Such an opportunity
offers itself in Mr. R. W. Surtees&rsquo; novel of &ldquo;Mr. Facey Romford&rsquo;s
Hounds.&rdquo; Compare John Leech&rsquo;s illustration, <i>Fresh as a Four-Year
Old</i> (the last he executed for the novelist before his firm, free
hand was paralysed by death), with Hablot Knight Browne&rsquo;s first
etching in the same book. A better subject, surely, could scarcely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>338</span>
have been selected: the hounds have just been let out of the
kennel, and in actual life would, of course, be scampering over the
place in all the exuberant consciousness of canine freedom;
the scene, in fact, would be redolent of life and excitement, which
is wholly wanting to Browne&rsquo;s illustration. &ldquo;Phiz,&rdquo; from boyhood,
had been accustomed to horses, and frequently hunted with the
Surrey hounds, and to this circumstance is due the facility with
which he usually delineated horses in the hunting field. In the
delineation of hunting scenes, however, he falls far behind John
Leech, and this inferiority is strikingly manifested in the illustration
to which we are now referring. If you compare the fragile men,
horses, and hounds, with those in Leech&rsquo;s last etching, you cannot
fail to be struck with the vigour and life-like reality of the latter
drawing. Browne&rsquo;s women as a rule are delicate, fragile, consumptive-looking
creatures. The one in the etching referred to is both
physically weak and a bad horsewoman to boot&mdash;sitting her horse
with all the ungracefulness of a sack of flour.</p>

<p>Another weakness of Hablot Knight Browne is a tendency to
reproduce. If you look at any of his &ldquo;interiors,&rdquo; it will be apparent
to you that the men and women&mdash;the furniture and fittings&mdash;the
room itself, you have seen any number of times before. Charles
Chesterfield becomes Nicholas Nickleby, and Nicholas Nickleby
Harry Lorrequer; and with the slightest possible rearrangement, the
scenes in which these gentlemen figure from time to time are so
much alike, that we are reminded for all the world of the set scenes
and artificial backgrounds of a photographer&rsquo;s, &ldquo;studio.&rdquo; Take
&ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby,&rdquo; by way of example: the room in which old
Ralph Nickleby first finds his poor relations, does duty (with the
slightest possible rearrangement) for the Yorkshire schoolmaster&rsquo;s
room at the Saracen&rsquo;s Head; while a room in Kenwig&rsquo;s house
becomes successively an apartment in Mr. Mantalini&rsquo;s residence, a
green-room, Mr. Ralph Nickleby&rsquo;s office, Mr. Charles Cheeryble&rsquo;s
room, a hairdresser&rsquo;s shop, and so on. The illustrations to a novel
may not inaptly be compared to the scenery and characters of a
drama, and a theatre furnished with such a dearth of scenery and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>339</span>
&ldquo;properties,&rdquo; would be a poor affair indeed. This tendency to reproduction
becomes strikingly apparent wherever a romantic hero puts
in an appearance. Thus, Mrs. Trollope&rsquo;s Charles Chesterfield in a
frock coat, becomes in a tailcoat Charles Dickens&rsquo;s Nicholas Nickleby;
in another frock coat, Martin Chuzzlewit; while a military surtout
converts him, with equal facility, into Charles Lever&rsquo;s Jack Hinton
or Harry Lorrequer, according to the exigencies of the costume.
The strange part of it is that this peculiarity is shown almost
exclusively in the delineation of heroes of fiction. The imagination
of the artist is evidently impressed by marked and clearly defined
characters such as Squeers, Pecksniff, Gamp, Dombey, Macstinger,
Quilp, or Carker, and their identity as a rule is admirably preserved.
If pressed for an explanation, it is possible that Browne might have
pleaded that heroes of romance present for the most part, with a few
notable exceptions, a strong family likeness, being little better than
dummies, introduced by their authors for the purpose of setting off
personages possessed of greater force of character and decision of
purpose. Be this as it may, the singular failing we refer to is
certainly no mere fancy of our own. Charles Lever himself complained
that in the supper scene of his second number, Lorrequer
bore so striking a resemblance to his contemporary, Nicholas
Nickleby; while his biographer, Mr. Fitzpatrick, observes that the
identity of Harry Lorrequer is never maintained throughout the
novel, that mercurial hero being alternately represented old, young,
good-looking, and ugly. So much indeed was Lever impressed with
the fact, that he actually besought the artist to represent O&rsquo;Malley
the <i>same person throughout the book</i>. A knowledge of Irish
physiognomy was essential to any illustrator of Lever&rsquo;s novels, and
Hablot Knight Browne was so innocent of this knowledge that the
author begged him to go down to the House of Commons and
study the faces of the Irish members there, as the only accessible
method of obtaining the necessary insight in England.</p>

<p>Hypercriticism, happily, would be out of place in a work dealing
with caricaturists and graphic humourists of the nineteenth century.
Faults such as those the author has ventured to indicate appear to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>340</span>
him faults indeed of a grave character; but, while conscious of
defects which cannot fail to be patent to the most ordinary observer,
he is conscious at the same time of the great abilities of the artist,
who like those of whom he has already treated, has passed over to
the ranks of &ldquo;the great majority.&rdquo; If the scenery and properties are
sometimes poor,&mdash;if there is no genius, and oftentimes a lack of
decision and reality, there is on the other hand no lack of talent;
and there are many designs of Hablot Knight Browne which place
him in the very first rank of English book illustrators. His etching
of <i>The Goblin and the Sexton</i> (the eccentric yew-tree notwithstanding),
<i>Mr. Pickwick in the Pound</i>, and the very admirable little
etchings which we find in that rare <i>Paper of Tobacco</i> by &ldquo;Joseph
Fume,&rdquo; may be favourably compared with some of the best comic
illustrations of George Cruikshank himself.</p>

<p class="ar">[<i>Face p. 340.</i></p></td></tr></table></div>

<p>Can any picture tell its story better than that first illustration to
<span class="sn">&ldquo;Nicholas Nickelby.&rdquo;</span>
&ldquo;Nicholas Nickleby,&rdquo; where old Ralph pays his &ldquo;visit to his poor
relations&rdquo;? Mark the supercilious air with which the vulgar moneylender
hands his hat to Nicholas, and the unveiled contempt with which
he receives the attentions of poor Mrs. Nickleby and her daughter. A
no less admirable illustration is the one wherein we see the Yorkshire
schoolmaster nibbing his pen, whilst Snawley consigns his wretched
step-sons to the tender mercies of the principal of Do-the-boys Hall.
Observe the extraordinary anatomical proportions, hat and toggery,
of Mr. Newman Noggs, as he stretches up to the top of the coach
to hand a letter to Nicholas. Regard the nightcap and head-gear of
the detestable Mrs. Squeers, as she administers matutinal brimstone
and treacle to the starving pupils of Do-the-boys Hall. Mark the
astonishment of Squeers and his victim, as the savage goes down
under the thundering blows of Nickleby&rsquo;s cane. Look at the old
imbecile declaring his passion for the foolish Mrs. Nickleby. Behold
his knee-breeches and shorts protruding from the chimney, when his
benighted intellect prompted him, at the imminent hazard of strangulation,
to pay a visit to the object of his affections <i>via</i> that unusually
circuitous route. Look at the fatal brawl between Sir Mulberry
Hawk and his hopeful pupil; and rejoice at the final retributive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id="page341"></a>341</span>
justice which overtakes Mrs. Squeers, when she falls into the hands
of her late victims, and is drenched in her turn with the loathsome
brew she had so long administered to themselves.</p>

<p>Specially noteworthy is the bright little picture on the title-page,
<span class="sn">&ldquo;Martin Chuzzlewit.&rdquo;</span>
where the coach, with its spanking four-in-hand, gallops on its
distant journey after depositing Martin Chuzzlewit at his destination.
The guard, as he mounts up behind, watches with curious
interest Pecksniff&rsquo;s unctuous reception of the new pupil. Nothing
can well be cleverer than his realization of the <i>Pleasant Little Family
Party at Mr. Pecksniff&rsquo;s</i>, where that hypocritical personage, surrounded
by foes, assumes a look of persecuted benevolence, and gravely
requests his daughter, when he takes his chamber candlestick that
night, to remind him to be more particular in praying for Mr.
Anthony Chuzzlewit, &ldquo;who had done him an injustice.&rdquo; <i>The Warm
Reception of Mr. Pecksniff by his Venerable Friend</i> gives us the liveliest
satisfaction. If old Chuzzlewit&rsquo;s face is one of the &ldquo;caricatures&rdquo;
referred to, it must be remembered that it is distorted with
passion, and the fact is forgotten in the satisfaction with which we
hail the detection and punishment of the whining rascal, the sting
of which is envenomed by the astounding revelation that all the
while he has been weaving his web of falsehood around his intended
victim, he himself has been the dupe of the man he had schemed so
long to hoodwink and deceive.</p>

<p>Regard again Quilp, the dwarf, and his elfin errand boy (in the
<span class="sn">&ldquo;The Old Curiosity Shop.&rdquo;</span>
&ldquo;Old Curiosity Shop&rdquo;), enjoying the agonies of Sampson Brass as he
essays to smoke a long churchwarden. Behold Quilp upon his back
taunting the large fierce dog with hideous grimaces, triumphant in
the consciousness that the shortness of his chain will not permit him
to advance another inch. Look at Mrs. Jarley&rsquo;s wax-work brigand,
&ldquo;with the blackest possible head and the clearest possible complexion,&rdquo;
going his rounds in the company of little Nell, his eyes
fixed on the miniature of his lady-love, and his hand pressed to his
stomach instead of his heart. Behold the dwarf once more, as he
entertains Sampson and his sister Sally in the ruined outhouse overlooking
the river; the rain pours down on the head of the hapless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>342</span>
attorney, who, with coat buttoned up to the chin, and evidently suffering
from severe influenza, looks the picture of shivering discomfort.
Although in no better plight herself, Sally rejoices in the sufferings
of her brother, and as she sips her tea, her repulsive features are
distorted with a hideous grin of satisfaction. Quilp, seated on his
barrel beneath the only remnants of a roof, occupies a comparatively
dry corner, and looks the very picture of rollicking fun and enjoyment.</p>

<p>But incomparably one of the best of Browne&rsquo;s comic illustrations
is the one in &ldquo;Dombey,&rdquo; wherein Captain Cuttle encounters Mrs.
Macstinger in charge of Bunsby, bent on rivetting matrimonial chains
upon that confused and ancient mariner. Bunsby is one of the
<span class="sn">&ldquo;Bunsby.&rdquo;</span>
happiest of Dickens&rsquo;s creations; stupid as an owl, he has nevertheless
an oracular mode of delivering himself, and the simple-minded
Cuttle places as much reliance upon this wooden-headed sailor as
the ancients did on the mysterious utterance of the Delphic Apollo.
That the powerful will of Macstinger should hold himself in subjugation
so long as he was under the dominion of her eye was a matter
of course; but that this man of wisdom should be so easily boarded
and captured by the enemy, is so absolutely beyond his simple comprehension
that he scratches his head in sheer amazement. As for
poor Bunsby, the cup of his humiliation is full. So far as his wooden
features are capable of expression, they indicate two distinct trains of
thought: a conviction that his own pretensions have been detected
and exposed, and a desire to run,&mdash;an inclination repressed by the
powerful clutch of his strong-minded bride, who retains his wrist in a
grasp of iron. Compare the look of bewilderment on Cuttle&rsquo;s face
with the look of mingled contempt and triumph on the features of
Macstinger; and then look at poor Bunsby!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Phiz&rdquo; began etching when he was seventeen, and was in full
work when he was twenty-one. It was his three drawings on the
wood for Dickens&rsquo;s rare tract, &ldquo;Sunday Under Three Heads,&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_173" href="#Footnote_173"><span class="sp">173</span></a>
which introduced him first to public notice. This was intended as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>343</span>
protest against the cant and narrow-mindedness of the bigots whose
ignorance of the sacred writings is so dense that they confound the
Jewish Sabbath (<i>i.e.</i> the Saturday) with the English Sunday; misunderstand
(which in their ignorance of Hebrew may be excusable)
the directions to <i>his own people</i> of the Jewish law-giver,&mdash;and ignore
(which is absolutely inexcusable) the dictates of common sense, and
the plain directions of our Saviour and of the Gentile Apostle. The
strong common sense of Charles Dickens, and of many good
Christian men after him, have striven in vain to expose an error due
to the narrow-mindedness of our Puritan forefathers, to whom are
due also the impurities of Dryden and of the dramatic writers of the
Restoration. Cant, however, has prevailed; and the English Sunday&mdash;to
the delight of these fanatics, and the absolute terror of their
children&mdash;remains the most unrefreshing and most doleful of the
seven days of the week.</p>

<p>Theatrical London in 1840 was visited by an excitement second
<span class="sn">The &ldquo;Jack Sheppard&rdquo; Mania.</span>
only to the &ldquo;Tom and Jerry&rdquo; mania of 1821. The mania of 1840, if
occupying a narrower area, was more morbid in its character, and
certainly not less mischievous in its results. Harrison Ainsworth
had brought out his peculiar romance of &ldquo;Jack Sheppard,&rdquo; which,
resting on its own merits, might have achieved perhaps a mild
popularity and done but little harm. Thanks, however, to the genius
and fancy of George Cruikshank, the public became for a time
Sheppard mad; the heroes presented to admiring and applauding
audiences at the theatres were murderers, housebreakers, highway
robbers, thieves, and their female companions. The morbid taste
of the populace had in fact been thoroughly roused, a condition of
things which was satirized by the artist&rsquo;s little-known etching of <i>The
Way to the Gallows made Easy and Pleasant</i>, which appeared in
&ldquo;The New Monthly Magazine&rdquo; of 1840.<a name="FnAnchor_174" href="#Footnote_174"><span class="sp">174</span></a> The inventive powers of
the artist were almost <i>nil</i>, and the rare and able etching referred to
was suggested to him by John Poole, the author of &ldquo;Paul Pry,&rdquo; to
whom we are indebted for the descriptive letterpress: &ldquo;At the foot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>344</span>
of a gently sloping path strewed with flowers, stands a gibbet decorated,
not with a halter, but wreaths of roses. Around it are many
tombs of elegant construction, supposed to enclose the ashes of the
illustrious departed. Upon one is inscribed, &lsquo;Here repose the
mortal remains of the ever-famed Jerry Abershaw&rsquo;; upon another,
&rsquo;Sacred to the memory of Poor Johnny Greenacre.&rsquo; A third is
remarkable for its touching simplicity&mdash;&rsquo;Alas! Poor Thurtell!&rsquo;
Another, somewhat more elaborate, gives us &lsquo;Burke and Hare!
As they were loving friends in life, so in death are they undivided!
Erected by their affectionate disciples, Bishop and May.&rsquo; Besides
these there are many others all bearing names of mark and fame.
The whole is surrounded by a pretty arabesque composed of crowbars
and other implements of burglary, pistols, knives, death&rsquo;s heads
and cross-bones, halters, handcuffs, and fetters, ingeniously disposed
and prettily intertwined with wreaths of roses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We said at the opening of this chapter that &ldquo;Phiz&rdquo; was not <i>born</i>
a comic artist. He possessed a certain amount of humour, which
was evoked in the first instance by the example of Cruikshank, and
his abilities and desire to emulate the greater artist have enabled
him unquestionably to realize many humorous designs. It is impossible,
however, to examine the numerous etchings of this draughtsman,
without coming to the conclusion that he is always seen at his
best when not called on to exercise his purely comic powers. Take
by way of example, <i>The Venice Glass</i>, in Ainsworth&rsquo;s romance
of &ldquo;Crichton&rdquo;; you will need no reference to the letterpress to
understand it, for the artist tells his story far better than the novelist.
Observe Crichton as he raises the goblet, and the poisoned wine
bubbles and boils, and finally shivers the chalice into a thousand
fragments; regard the agitation of Marguerite de Valois; the keen
attention of Henri and his attendants. Where shall we find a finer
illustration than the one in this book in which Esclairmonde is
presented to Henri? The meeting of Mr. Tigg and Martin Chuzzlewit
at the pawnbroker&rsquo;s shop is full of pathos. Look at the poor,
wasted but still handsome mother waiting her turn whilst the gin-drinking
laundress pawns her flat-irons to gratify her passion for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>345</span>
deadly drink; note the <i>insouciance</i> of the thoughtless musician as he
twangs the guitar which he is about to pledge, though probably
dependent on it for bread. Notice the pictures above,&mdash;the
Bacchante pressing grapes into a wine cup,&mdash;the bailiff distraining
for rent. Hablot Knight Browne has no powers which would enable
us to compare him with Hogarth, and yet the grim reality of this
picture Hogarth himself might almost admire.</p>

<p>Regard again that wondrous tailpiece at page 96 of &ldquo;The Old
Curiosity Shop,&rdquo; where Quilp, the odious dwarf, sits up all night
smoking and drinking, his countenance every now and then &ldquo;expanding
with a grin of delight&rdquo; as his patient, long-suffering wife
makes some involuntary movement of restlessness or fatigue. Look
at poor, wasted, shoeless Nell, as she reclines on the settee of
the public-house, surrounded by sympathisers,&mdash;the kind-hearted
motherly landlady administering mental and bodily solace to the
motherless child,&mdash;the poor, foolish, gambling grandfather gazing
into her face with wistful anxiety. Lastly, look at the ghastly
corpse of old Quilp as he lies dead amid the mud and slime of
the river, which, after playing with the ugly, malicious, ill-shapen
thing until it was bereft of life, flung it contemptuously high and
dry upon the swamps at low tide.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dombey and Son&rdquo; called for comparatively little exercise of
<span class="sn">&ldquo;Dombey and Son.&rdquo;</span>
Browne&rsquo;s <i>comic</i> power, and consequently we shall find in this book
examples of some of his finest book etchings. The pompous London
merchant, the frigid influence he exercises on those about him,
the distrustful look of the nurse as she brings baby Paul into his
presence, the shrinking form of little Florence as the frightened
child cowers with folded hands behind her repellent father&rsquo;s chair,
are finely depicted in the etching of <i>The Dombey Family</i>. In <i>Mrs.
Dombey at Home</i>, the proud, haughty beauty chafing under the consciousness
that she has been sacrificed to the wealth of the heartless
merchant, takes no pains to veil the contempt she feels for the
admiring men who surround her. These men (by the way) are
scarcely men at all, they are all grossly exaggerated; but &ldquo;Phiz,&rdquo; like
many artists of greater pretensions, has sacrificed everything to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>346</span>
central figure, and the presence and bearing of the disdainful beauty
makes the <i>coup d&rsquo;&oelig;il</i> delightful. <i>Abstraction and Recognition</i> is a
wonderful etching; both man and horse are admirably drawn,
whilst the figures scowling out of the dark entry on the passing and
unconscious horseman require no reference to the letterpress. In
his etching of <i>The Dark Road</i>, Mr. Browne developed a style of
etching of which he afterwards frequently availed himself, and by
which (as in &ldquo;Bleak House&rdquo; and &ldquo;Roland Cashel&rdquo;) he sometimes
succeeded in producing remarkable effects. It shows us a postilion
driving a team of horses over a dark and dreary road bordered on
either hand by dismal moorland; the streaks of the approaching
dawn illuminate the edges of the landscape; the single occupant of
the berlin, unable to control his agitation, stands upright, and gazes
anxiously around him. So realistic is the drawing, that as we look
at the flying team we may almost hear the jingle of the splinter-bars
and harness as the horses rattle along the dismal road. Cruikshank,
to save his life, could draw neither a horse, a tree, or a pretty woman;
when he did so it was rather by accident than by design. &ldquo;Phiz&rdquo;
(with all his faults) could draw all three, and impart to them a grace,
a beauty, and a poetry peculiar to himself. Look at that etching
of <i>Carker in his Hour of Triumph</i>, where Edith, after using the
villain as a tool to revenge herself upon her husband, turns upon
her miserable dupe with all the force of her superior intellect, and
laughs in the face of the man she has so egregiously befooled.
This really is an admirable drawing; the anger and humiliation on
the face of the dumbfounded villain, who feels himself absolutely
powerless in the hands of the scornful, resolute woman, are powerfully
depicted. A more perfect realization of Edith Dombey it
seems to us could scarcely be imagined. Leech, <i>perhaps</i>, might have
reached the idea. He would certainly have put more breadth and
solidity into the figure of Carker; but the woman he could scarcely
have improved upon&mdash;I doubt if he could have matched her. As for
Cruikshank, he would have given her an impossible waist, a puffy
face surmounted with bandeaux of raven hair scrupulously plastered
to each side of her lofty forehead; whilst Carker would have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page347" id="page347"></a>347</span>
presented to us in an uncomfortable coat, hair parted and dressed
after the Cruikshankian fashion, and a pair of boots at least half a
yard in length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bleak House&rdquo; (1852-3) has been described as the most successful
<span class="sn">&ldquo;Bleak House&rdquo; and &ldquo;Roland Cashel.&rdquo;</span>
of &ldquo;Phiz&rsquo;s&rdquo; illustrated work; but although it contains some
of the best etchings he ever designed for Charles Dickens, the rest
are in truth of unequal merit. Among the best may be mentioned
<i>Consecrated Ground</i>; <i>The Old Man of the name of Tulkinghorn</i>;
<i>Morning</i>; <i>Tom All Alone&rsquo;s</i>; and the sunset scene in the <i>Long
Drawing-room at Chesney Wold</i>. In the dreary twilight of the <i>Ghost&rsquo;s
Walk</i> and of the room in which the murder was consummated we
have a pair of drawings unsurpassed by any of the illustrations he
executed for Charles Lever&rsquo;s &ldquo;Roland Cashel,&rdquo; which last contains
unquestionably the finest of his designs.</p>

<p>Of all his illustrators, Hablot Knight Browne was the one who
best suited the requirements of Charles Dickens. A man of talent
without a single idea of his own, he was found more malleable and
manageable than Cruikshank, who, as we have seen, would have
had a hand (if he could) not only in the illustrations, but also in the
management of the story. The conditions under which &ldquo;Phiz&rdquo;
illustrated &ldquo;Pickwick&rdquo; were wholly different from those which poor
Seymour had endeavoured to impose upon his author. &ldquo;It is due
to the gentleman,&rdquo; says Dickens, in his preface to the &ldquo;Pickwick
Papers,&rdquo; &ldquo;It is due to the gentleman whose designs accompany the
letterpress, to state that the interval has been so short between the
production of each number in manuscript and its appearance in
print, that the greater portion of the illustrations have been executed
by the artist from the author&rsquo;s <i>verbal description of what he intended
to write</i>.&rdquo; Cruikshank would certainly not have done this, and we
doubt whether John Leech would have consented to work under
such conditions. But as regards Browne, the case was entirely
different. He had no <i>genius</i> or ideas of his own, and could only
work from the suggestions of others. The interest and anxiety which
Dickens felt in the character of the illustrations to his novels, is
shown by reference to the illustrations to &ldquo;Dombey.&rdquo; &ldquo;The points
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>348</span>
for illustration, and the enormous care required, make me,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;excessively anxious! The man for Dombey, if Browne could see
him, the class of man to a T, is Sir A&mdash;&mdash; E&mdash;&mdash;, of D&mdash;&mdash;s. Great
pains will be necessary with Miss Tox. The Toodle family should
not be too much caricatured, because of Polly.&rdquo; As the story
unwinds itself, he proceeds, &ldquo;Browne is certainly interesting himself
and taking pains;&rdquo; and again, in another letter, &ldquo;Browne seems to
be getting on well.&rdquo; Still &ldquo;Browne,&rdquo; with all his pliability, found it
a hard matter to please him. He made a particular point of Paul,
Mrs. Pipchin, and the cat by the fire; and the result to himself was
so eminently unsatisfactory that it produced a characteristic protest.
&ldquo;I am really distressed by the illustration of Mrs. Pipchin and Paul.
It is so frightfully and wildly wide of the mark. Good heaven! in
the commonest and most literal construction of the text, it is all
wrong! She is described as an old lady, and Paul&rsquo;s &lsquo;miniature arm-chair&rsquo;
is mentioned more than once. He ought to be sitting in a
little arm-chair down in a corner of the fireplace, staring up at her.
I can&rsquo;t say what pain and vexation it is to be so utterly misrepresented.
I would cheerfully have given a hundred pounds to have
left this illustration out of the book. He never could have got that
idea of Mrs. Pipchin if he had attended to the text. Indeed, I
think he does better without the text; for then the notion is made
easy to him, a <i>short description</i>, and <i>he can&rsquo;t help taking it in</i>.&rdquo; This
last sentence exactly describes the man: a personal description with
him did more than any amount of letterpress, however lucid.</p>

<p>One may readily understand this almost nervous anxiety of
Charles Dickens with reference to the <i>character</i> of his illustrations.
He worked, be it remembered, under conditions entirely different to
the novelist of a later date. The etched illustrations of his day
formed a most important&mdash;in some cases (the works of inferior
men, such as Albert Smith, for instance) by far the most important&mdash;portion
of the work itself. Under the charm of the illustrations and
the mode of issue, the tale was protracted to a length which would
be impossible in a novel of Charles Reade or Wilkie Collins, which
depends for its success upon the skill of the novelist alone. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id="page349"></a>349</span>
novel issued in monthly numbers depended on two sources of attraction&mdash;the
skill of the novelist and the skill of his artistic coadjutor.
Dickens&rsquo; requirements, however, were of so exacting a nature that
they proved in the end too exacting even for the patience of the
accommodating artist, and the reader will not be surprised to learn
that a coolness was ultimately established between artist and author,
the outcome of which was the employment of Marcus Stone and
Luke Fildes on the later novels of &ldquo;Our Mutual Friend&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Edwin Drood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Those who would find fault with Charles Dickens for the mode in
which he controlled his artists quite fail to understand the man
himself. Although he had no knowledge of the pencil, although he
himself had no knowledge of drawing, he was nevertheless a thorough
artist in heart and mind. There is scarcely a character in his books
which does not show the care and thought which he bestowed <span class="correction" title="Comma removed after 'upon'">upon</span>
its elaboration. Ralph Nickleby, Squeers, Smike, little Nell, Quilp,
Barnaby Rudge, Steerforth, Paul Dombey, Lady Dedlock, Joe,
each and all show how carefully they were elaborated; how distinctly
they presented themselves to the retina of the mind of their
distinguished creator. When this is borne in mind, it will be at
once understood why the Mrs. Pipchin of Hablot Browne was not
<i>the</i> Mrs. Pipchin with whose outward appearance and mental peculiarities
the author himself was so intimately acquainted.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the exhibition, after his death, of water-colours
<span class="sn">&ldquo;Auriol.&rdquo;</span>
and other works, which took the public by surprise, Hablot Knight
Browne will continue to be known to most of us as an illustrator of
books, and nothing more. &ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m aweary, I&rsquo;m aweary,&rdquo; he said
himself in a letter to one of his sons, &ldquo;of this illustration business.&rdquo;
Some of these illustrations, however, are wonderfully graceful, and
one in particular seems to call for special notice. It will be found
in the &ldquo;New Monthly Magazine&rdquo; for 1845, and is undoubtedly one of
the best examples of the artist&rsquo;s work which may be found anywhere.
It represents a prisoner in a dungeon lying at the foot of a pillar,
which, except in a ghastly carved work running round it of skulls
and cross bones, reminds us somewhat of Bonneval&rsquo;s pillar at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>350</span>
Chillon. The lights and shadows are wonderfully rendered, and
the work is characterized by a softness, a beauty, and a finish only
to be observed in work which took the artist&rsquo;s fancy. This etching
is entitled, <i>Rougemont&rsquo;s Device to Perplex Auriol</i>; and Ainsworth&rsquo;s
story which it illustrates&mdash;a peculiarly unsatisfactory one&mdash;commenced,
I think, in &ldquo;Ainsworth&rsquo;s Magazine,&rdquo; passed into the &ldquo;New
Monthly,&rdquo; when its author purchased that periodical in 1845, and
(whether the novelist got himself into an intellectual fix or otherwise
I know not) finished, I believe, eventually nowhere.</p>

<p>Browne indeed finds a place here more by virtue of his book
illustrations than by reason of any just pretensions to be considered
a graphic humourist. His comic powers appear to us more the
result of education and emulation than natural gifts, and the consequence
is, that in attempting to be funny, his work too often
degenerates into absolute exaggeration. His excellencies must be
sought for in his serious illustrations, which fall more within the
province of the art critic than the scope and purpose of a work
which treats of graphic satirists and comic artists of the nineteenth
century. Some of his finest illustrations of a serious character will
be found in the pages of the &ldquo;Illuminated Magazine&rdquo;; in Charles
Lever&rsquo;s admirable story of &ldquo;St. Patrick&rsquo;s Eve&rdquo;; in the &ldquo;Fortunes
of Colonel Forlogh O&rsquo;Brien&rdquo;; in Augustus Mayhew&rsquo;s &ldquo;Paved with
Gold&rdquo;; in Ainsworth&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mervyn Clithero&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Revelations of
London&rdquo;; and above all, in Charles Lever&rsquo;s novel of &ldquo;Roland
Cashel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hablot Knight Browne lived to see the decline and fall of that
peculiar and powerful art of book illustration which was introduced
by Cruikshank; was fostered and encouraged by Charles Dickens,
Charles James Lever, their imitators and contemporaries; and died,
so to speak, with these distinguished men. His work in later years,
as might naturally have been expected, shows a woeful decline of
power; and when the suggestors from whom he derived inspiration
were no longer at his back, the poverty of invention which characterized
the man when left to his own devices becomes painfully
apparent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>351</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Phiz&rdquo; drew in later years for <i>Judy</i> and other comic papers,
and it is simple justice to say that his designs are characterized by
an utter absence of comic power. The true comic inspiration possessed
in so wonderful a degree by Cruikshank, by John Leech,
and even by Robert Seymour, he never indeed possessed. Some
fifteen years before his death he suffered from incipient paralysis,
and furthermore injured his thumb, which obliged him to hold his
pencil between his middle and fore-fingers. Gradually this great
and graceful artist dropped so far behind in the race of life that he
yielded latterly to proposals to illustrate boys&rsquo; literature of a very
inferior class.</p>

<p>In addition to an absence of comic inspiration, the <i>creative</i> faculty
of Cruikshank and Leech was wanting to Hablot Knight Browne.
In order to carry out an idea, it was necessary that it should be
put into his head; for leave him to himself, and he could do absolutely
nothing.<a name="FnAnchor_175" href="#Footnote_175"><span class="sp">175</span></a> George Cruikshank and John Leech after receiving
instructions would proceed to realize them in their own way and
after their own fashion; but this was not the case with Hablot
Knight Browne. While he could realize the idea of another with
peculiar success when the subject took his fancy, he could neither
enlarge nor improve upon it, and in this lies the difference between
<i>genius</i> and mere ability. Lacking an inherent sense of humour, he
copied Cruikshank, and hence his exaggerations and failures as a
<i>comic</i> designer; but he was <i>ultimus Romanorum</i>,&mdash;the last representative
of the famous men whose art was fostered and encouraged
by Charles Dickens, by Charles Lever, by Harrison Ainsworth, and
by Richard Bentley. The services which these eminent men rendered
to the novelists who like them are dead and gone can scarcely
be appreciated; for we presume few will deny that their labours lent
a charm, a beauty, and an interest to their works, which largely
tended to promote their sale. The fortunes of &ldquo;Jack Sheppard,&rdquo; of
&ldquo;The Miser&rsquo;s Daughter,&rdquo; of &ldquo;The Tower of London,&rdquo;&mdash;the success
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>352</span>
obtained by nearly all the stories of Ainsworth which obtained any
success at all, was mainly due to the pencil of Cruikshank. The
reputation of &ldquo;Oliver Twist&rdquo;&mdash;a morbid novel&mdash;was made in a great
measure by <i>him</i>; but for John Leech, neither &ldquo;Mr. Ledbury,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Scattergood Family,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Marchioness of Brinvilliers,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Richard
Savage,&rdquo; would have survived to our day. To him the novels of
Mr. R. W. Surtees owe their entire popularity; while his genius
has conferred vitality on the rubbish of À Beckett. It is curious,
however, how little these facts were recognised at the time, and
what little credit was given in contemporary reviews and by contemporary
critics to the artists who rendered to successful novelists
the priceless aid and assistance of their pencils.</p>

<p>How far the needle of &ldquo;Phiz&rdquo; contributed to the ultimate success
of the great <i>raconteur</i>, Charles James Lever, we are in no position to
state; that it proved a very large factor in that result there can be
no manner of doubt. That success was not achieved immediately.
Lever commenced life as a struggling country doctor, and &ldquo;Harry
Lorrequer,&rdquo; first brought out in the &ldquo;Dublin University Magazine,&rdquo;
before it appeared in illustrated shilling numbers, was almost wholly
ignored by the London press, the criticisms and favourable remarks
coming almost wholly from provincial journals. There was one
exception by the way, a military paper, the critic of which went into
such ecstacies over this sparkling military medley, that he asserted
he would rather be author of &ldquo;Lorrequer&rdquo; than of all the &ldquo;Pickwicks&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Nicklebys&rdquo; in the world. This notice (unknown to
Lever) was published with the advertisements of the book, and
(strange to say) gave so much annoyance to Dickens that he sent an
angry reply to a civil letter which came to him shortly afterwards
from the Irish novelist, and their friendly intercourse was for some
years suspended in consequence.</p>

<p>The decline of Hablot Browne&rsquo;s popularity was painfully apparent
to himself. Although our chapter was written long before the appearance
of Mr. Kitton&rsquo;s pamphlet, we may be permitted to re-open it to
extract from the latter the following melancholy observations which
we find in a letter to his son, Dr. Browne: &ldquo;I am at present on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page353" id="page353"></a>353</span>
sporting paper, supported by some high and mighty nobs; but I fear,
<i>like everything I have to do with, now a-days</i>, it will collapse, for
some of the proprietors of the paper are also shareholders, etc., etc.,
in the Graphotype Company, so they want to work the two together.
I hate the process; it takes quite four times as long as wood, and I
cannot draw and express myself with a nasty, finicking brush, and
the result when printed seems to alternate between something all as
black as my hat, or as hazy and faint as a worn-out plate. If on
wood, I should like it well enough; as it is it spoils four days a
week, leaving little time for anything else. Oh! I&rsquo;m aweary, I&rsquo;m
aweary! of this illustration business.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_176" href="#Footnote_176"><span class="sp">176</span></a> This seems to us inexpressibly
sad. We hear nothing of it in earlier days, when he was drawing
the excellent designs for &ldquo;Roland Cashel,&rdquo; for &ldquo;Dombey,&rdquo; or for
&ldquo;Bleak House.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of the works and sketches in water colour and oils exhibited in
Liverpool after the artist&rsquo;s death, personally we have seen nothing.
They took the public by surprise, for few at least of the outer world
suspected that this shy, retiring illustrator of books was a persevering
and accomplished water-colour artist. We ourselves were aware of
the fact, and had seen some thirty original and highly characteristic
sketches, some of them studies of characters in novels of Charles
Dickens and Lever; all executed prior to 1846, some in Indian ink,
some in crayon, a few in pencil. Among them was a small but highly
finished water-colour drawing, representing a group of seven knights
in full martial panoply, and a striking effect is produced by the glint
of the sun on the burnished armour of the central figure. The author
of a recent sketch would cite these water colours as a complete
answer to those who like ourselves maintain, in no mere spirit of
detraction, that the artist possessed not one particle of <i>genius</i>.
Surely he cannot be in earnest. If so, we have only to say, that if
painting subjects in oils or water colour from the thousand and one
hints to be gathered from history, fiction, or every-day life, be a test
of <i>genius</i>, the walls of every summer and winter exhibition&mdash;to say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354"></a>354</span>
nothing of the Royal Academy&mdash;would be furnished annually with
examples from end to end.</p>

<p>Leech died in the meridian of his fame at the early age of forty-six.
Hablot Browne when he died had not only survived his talents,
but his peculiarly shy and retiring nature had caused him at the age
of sixty-seven to be absolutely forgotten. The famous men of letters
whose works he had illustrated were dead and gone; the world of
literature and of art took such small note of him that his funeral was
the funeral of a private individual, and not of one who, if he did not
partake in, had contributed in no considerable degree to the success
of Charles Dickens and of Charles James Lever. When his passing-bell
rang out upon the summer air, journalists remembered that a
great artist was gone to his rest, and <i>Punch</i> inserted in his number
of the 22nd of July, 1882, to the memory of the last of the book
etchers of the nineteenth century the following graceful tribute:&mdash;</p>

<h5><i>A BATCH OF BOOK ILLUSTRATORS:</i></h5>

<h5><i>KENNY MEADOWS; ROBERT WILLIAM BUSS; ALFRED CROWQUILL;</i>
<i>CHARLES H. BENNETT; W. M. THACKERAY.</i></h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">In</span> old and second-hand bookshops, and in booksellers&rsquo; catalogues,
may often be found a book which is gradually becoming a literary
rarity. It dates from 1840, and is a curiosity in its way, not
only on account of the &ldquo;portraits&rdquo; which adorn its pages, but as
a specimen of the literary padding on which men of letters (some
of them distinguished) were content to employ their talents fifty
years ago. It was published by Robert Tyas, of 50, Cheapside;
professed to give &ldquo;Portraits of the English&rdquo; of the period, but
served as a means of introducing certain characteristic pictorial
sketches, more or less true to nature, by Kenny Meadows, an
artist whose name and reputation, although he has been dead
scarcely ten years, are already forgotten. Connected with these
portraits are &ldquo;original essays by distinguished writers,&rdquo; including,
amid names of lesser note, literary stars such as Douglas Jerrold,
Leman Rede, Percival Leigh, Laman Blanchard, Leigh Hunt,
William Howitt, and Samuel Lover. These essays, or rather letterpress
descriptions, were written to the pictures, which were not
drawn (as is generally supposed) in illustration of the text. The
portraits are taken from almost every grade in life: from the dressmaker
to the draper&rsquo;s assistant, and from the housekeeper to the
hangman; the last, by the way, being perhaps the most characteristic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>356</span>
sketch of the series. The best of these forty-three &ldquo;pictures&rdquo; is the
one which faces the title-page, a gathering of the company which
individually take part in this &ldquo;gallery of illustration.&rdquo; The designs
are characteristic of the artist&rsquo;s style, but possess little power of
attraction, being destitute of any claim to originality either of conception
or treatment. The artist&rsquo;s share of the work is by far the
best part of the somewhat lugubrious entertainment, which the
performances of his literary associates scarcely serve to enliven.
The book, however, was a success in its day, for, if we mistake
not, it was followed by a second series, is even now sought after
by the &ldquo;collector&rdquo; (not bibliomaniac), and possesses some historical
value by reason of the fact that national types, such as <i>The
Diner-out</i>, <i>The Stockbroker</i>, <i>The Lion of the Party</i>, <i>The Fashionable
Physician</i> (that is to say, of 1840), <i>The Linen Draper&rsquo;s Assistant</i>,
<i>The Barmaid</i>, <i>The Family Governess</i>, <i>The Postman</i>, <i>The Theatrical
Manager</i>, <i>The Farmer&rsquo;s Daughter</i>, and <i>The Young Lord</i>, no longer
live and move and act their part amongst us. A change comes over
the people in the course of forty years, and some years hence our
grandchildren may well smile at the extraordinary monstrosities
(female) who figure in the graphic satires of 1883-4.</p>

<p>Kenny Meadows was the son of a retired naval officer, and was
born at Cardigan on the first of November, 1790. You will look
in vain for any notice of him, or of his services in the cause of
illustrative art, in any of the biographical dictionaries of his own
or a subsequent period; and this appears to us an unaccountable
omission, for he achieved in his time considerable celebrity as an
artistic illustrator of books. His work will be found bound up with
that of most of his artistic <i>confrères</i> in nearly all the illustrated
periodicals of his day; he was one of the first to introduce wood-engraving
among English publishers as a means of cheap and
popular illustration; he was employed by the late Mr. Ingram, in
the designs for the early Christmas numbers of the <i>Illustrated
London News</i>; he will be found amongst the number of the artists
who illustrated the early volumes of <i>Punch</i>; he was in universal
request as a designer of drawings to fairy and fanciful stories;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page357" id="page357"></a>357</span>
among his intimate friends were men of mark; such as Leigh Hunt,
Douglas Jerrold, Charles Dickens, W. M. Thackeray, Clarkson
Stanfield, David Roberts, and the Landseers; he did as much
for illustrative art as, perhaps, any artist of his time; and yet,
amongst men whose abilities scarcely exceeded his own in the same
particular walk in art, no place is to be found in any biographical
dictionary, so far at least as we know, for any mention of poor,
kindly, genial, Kenny Meadows.</p>

<p>Besides the popular illustrated periodicals of his day, in most
of which his familiar initials may be recognised, Kenny Meadows
was in almost universal request both amongst authors and publishers
of the time. We find him in 1832 illustrating, with Isaac
Robert Cruikshank, a periodical bearing the somewhat unpromising
title of &ldquo;The Devil in London.&rdquo; To an 1833 edition of &ldquo;Gil Blas,&rdquo;
illustrated by George Cruikshank, he contributed a frontispiece; and
we find his hand in the following: the late J. B. Buckstone&rsquo;s dramas
of &ldquo;The Wreck Ashore,&rdquo; &ldquo;Victorine,&rdquo; &ldquo;May Queen,&rdquo; &ldquo;Henriette,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Rural Felicity,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pet of the Petticoats,&rdquo; &ldquo;Married Life,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Rake and his Pupil,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Christening,&rdquo; &ldquo;Isabella,&rdquo; &ldquo;Second
Thoughts,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Scholar&rdquo; (1835, 1836); Whitehead&rsquo;s &ldquo;Autobiography
of Jack Ketch&rdquo; (1835); &ldquo;Heads of the People, or Portraits
of the English&rdquo; (1841); Mr. S. C. Hall&rsquo;s &ldquo;Book of British
Ballads&rdquo; (1842-44); an 1842 edition of Moore&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lalla Rookh&rdquo;;
Leigh Hunt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Palfrey, a Love Story of Old Times&rdquo; (1842); &ldquo;The
Illuminated Magazine&rdquo; (1843); Shakespeare (1843); &ldquo;Whist, its
History and Practice&rdquo;; &ldquo;Backgammon, its History and Practice,&rdquo;
by the same author; &ldquo;The Illustrated London Almanacks&rdquo; (from
1845 upwards); Sir Edward Lytton Bulwer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Leila,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Calderon&rdquo;
(1847); W. N. Bailey&rsquo;s &ldquo;Illustrated Musical Annual,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Family Joe Miller, a Drawing-room Jest Book&rdquo; (1848); &ldquo;Puck,&rdquo;
(a comic serial, 1848); Laman Blanchard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sketches from Life&rdquo;
(1849); Samuel Lover&rsquo;s &ldquo;Metrical Tales and Poems;&rdquo; &ldquo;The Magic
of Kindness,&rdquo; by the brothers Mayhew; Mrs. S. C. Hall&rsquo;s &ldquo;Midsummer
Eve;&rdquo; &ldquo;Punch,&rdquo; up to and including the seventh volume;
and (some time afterwards) its able opponent &ldquo;The Man in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page358" id="page358"></a>358</span>
Moon&rdquo; (now exceedingly scarce).<a name="FnAnchor_177" href="#Footnote_177"><span class="sp">177</span></a> In these and very many other
works we find him associated not only with George Cruikshank, John
Leech, Hablot Knight Browne, and Richard Doyle, but with artists
occupying the position of Sir John Gilbert, Frank Stone, Maclise,
Clarkson Stanfield, Creswick, E. M. Ward, Elmore, Frost, Sir J.
Noel Paton, Frederick Goodall, Thomas Landseer, F. W. Popham,
Fairholt, Harrison Weir, Redgrave, Corbould, and Stephanoff. He
was a thoroughly useful man; and a thousand examples of quaint
imaginings&mdash;oftentimes of graceful workmanship&mdash;might be culled
from the various works and serials in which his hand may be readily
recognised.</p>

<p>But the merits of Kenny Meadows as an illustrator of books are
very unequal. His friend, Mr. Hodder, who gives us in his pleasant
&ldquo;Memories&rdquo; an occasional note of some of the artists with whom
he was thrown in contact, says of him: &ldquo;The quiet, unostentatious
way in which he worked at his art, too often under the most adverse
and discouraging circumstances, and the pride which he displayed
when he felt he had made a &lsquo;happy hit,&rsquo; was somewhat like the
enthusiasm of a youth who had first attained the honour of a prize.
As a draughtsman he never cared to be guided by those practical
laws which regulate the academic exercise of the pictorial art; for
he contended that too strict an adherence to nature only trammelled
him, and he preferred relying upon the thought conveyed in his
illustrations, rather than upon the mechanical correctness of his
outline or perspective.&rdquo; George Cruikshank showed, as we know, a
tolerable contempt for nature when he undertook the delineation of
a horse, a woman, or a tree; but it was one of the conditions of his
<i>genius</i> that it should be left free and untrammelled to follow the
dictates of its own inspiration, and the quaint effect which somehow
or other he managed to impart to a design which, in its details might
offend the educated taste of the art critic, made us forget the
contempt too often displayed for those &ldquo;practical laws&rdquo; to which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page359" id="page359"></a>359</span>
Mr. Hodder refers. To constitute a good comic artist, not only is it
necessary that he should be a good draughtsman, but certain special
gifts are indispensable,&mdash;a keen sense of the ridiculous, an inherent
appreciation of humour, a quick and ready invention, qualities which
no amount of artificial training will bestow. They were possessed in
an eminent degree by Gillray, by Cruikshank, by John Leech, but
were wholly wanting to Kenny Meadows. He could draw on
occasion a queer face&mdash;for that matter his faces, intentionally or
otherwise, were generally queer&mdash;and an eccentric figure, and so can
many persons who have a natural taste for drawing, and have learnt
to handle the pencil; but the caricaturist, like the poet, <i>nasciiur non
fit</i>, and a hundred or even a thousand queer faces or eccentric
figures, without the gift of invention or originality, will not of themselves
constitute the designer a comic artist. The truth is that with
Kenny Meadows mannerism takes the place of genius. You will
recognise his hand anywhere without the familiar &ldquo;K.M.&rdquo; appended
to it, for all his faces are chubby (not to say puffy), and their arms
and legs look for all the world as if the hand that designed them had
been guided by a ruler. The delusion which led him to imagine
that his &ldquo;genius&rdquo; would enable him to soar superior to nature is no
doubt responsible in some degree for this latter eccentricity, for the
artist who would be bold enough to despise the laws &ldquo;which regulate
the exercise of the pictorial art,&rdquo; would be prepared to view
Hogarth&rsquo;s line of beauty with like indifference and contempt.</p>

<p>Kenny Meadows was one of the early illustrators of <i>Punch</i>, and
contributed moreover to the first volume some of the best of the
cartoons. Good specimens of his work will be found in <i>Young
Loves to Sell</i>, and <i>The Speculative Mama</i> (<i>sic</i>), second vol.; in
the third volume he illustrated &ldquo;Punch&rsquo;s Letters to His Son,&rdquo; and
the first of the almanacks contains six of his designs. In the fourth
volume we find six of his cartoons, among them <i>The Milk of Poor
Law Kindness</i>, and <i>The First Tooth</i> (the Queen and infant Prince of
Wales); the doctor&rsquo;s legs and shoes are thoroughly characteristic of
his style, and look for all the world as if they had been drawn by
a ruler. The cartoon, <i>Punch Turned Out of France</i> in this volume is,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id="page360"></a>360</span>
if we mistake not, the work of Kenny Meadows. <i>The Christian
Bayadere Worshipping the Idol Siva</i>, has reference to the tolerance
which &ldquo;John Company&rdquo; wisely conceded to Hindoo religious
ceremony, so long as its traditions were found consistent with the
ordinary dictates of humanity. &ldquo;The Story of a Feather&rdquo; in this
volume has five illustrations, two of which are very clever. Among
the other cartoons we find <i>The Modern Macheath</i> (the Captain being
Sir Robert Peel). The fifth volume contains eight of his illustrations,
six being cartoons; among them, <i>The Irish Frankenstein</i> (badly
imagined and atrociously drawn), <i>The Water Drop</i> and the <i>Gin
Drop</i> are characterized by much poverty of invention, but the
former is the best of the two. <i>The Battle of the Alphabet</i> (cartoon)
is a better specimen of his work, although the legs and arms look as
usual, as if drawn with a ruler. The sixth volume contains three of
his cartoons, while the almanack of the year (1844) has several of
his illustrations. To the seventh volume he contributed no less than
thirty-one illustrations, some very good, one of the best being that
of the two legal dogs quarrelling over a bone of litigation. <i>Punch</i> at
the outset of his career had considerable difficulty in the selection
of a graphic satirist, and one of his &ldquo;right hand men&rdquo; in those
early days was a Mr. Henning, by whose side Kenny Meadows
figures as an absolute genius. After his seventh volume, however,
he met with artists better fitted to interpret his political and social
views, and no trace of Meadows&rsquo; useful hand appears in succeeding
volumes.</p>

<p>In stating that the merits of Kenny Meadows as an illustrator of
books are unequal, and in denying to him the possession of genius,
we must not be held to imply that he was deficient of talent. An
excellent example of the inequality of which we speak will be found
in his Shakespeare (Robert Tyas, 1843), a work selected by us for
the reason that it was considered by himself and his two favourable
friends as his masterpiece. Although we cannot stay to notice all
the strange conceptions with which he has enriched this book, we
may be permitted to wonder whence he derived his preposterous
ideas of Caliban, of Malvolio, of Shylock, of Juliet&rsquo;s nurse, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page361" id="page361"></a>361</span>
Launce&rsquo;s unhappy dog, of the Egpytian Sphynx in &ldquo;Antony and
Cleopatra.&rdquo; The model of Shylock was evidently some &ldquo;old clo&rsquo;&rdquo;
dealer in Petticoat Lane. The figure of Armado (&ldquo;Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s
Lost&rdquo;) is so wonderfully put together that his anatomy must sooner
or later fall to pieces; the ghost of Hamlet&rsquo;s father is the ghost of
some colossal statue, certainly not the shade of one who had worn
the guise of ordinary humanity. The head of the gentle Juliet
might derive benefit from the application of a bottle of invigorating
hair wash. The figure of the monk in &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo; literally
cut out of wood, carries as much expression in its face as a lay figure;
while the walls of Northampton Castle (in &ldquo;King John&rdquo;) are so
much out of the perpendicular, that the courtiers seem less concerned
at finding the dead body of Arthur, than in seeking a place of
shelter from the impending downfall. Henry the Eighth, although
acknowledged to be a corpulent, was not, so far as we know, a
deformed man; the preposterous &ldquo;beak&rdquo; of Richard the Third
occupies one half of his otherwise remarkably short face, and its
owner (in the well-known tent scene) suffers from an attack of tetanus
instead of an accession of mental terror. These eccentric realizations,
in which he has succeeded in setting all the rules of drawing at
defiance, are rendered the more remarkable by reason of the circumstance
that the work now under consideration is interspersed with
numerous charming drawings, the effect of which is wholly marred
by these erratic performances. Meadows was an admirable water-colour
artist, and a scarce edition of this work contains some
engravings of Shakespearian heroines after his designs. The
Germans fancy they understand Shakespeare better than ourselves
(an amiable and complimentary weakness), and the work was
favourably received in Germany, the artist&rsquo;s conception of Falstaff,
in particular, being so highly appreciated that a bronze statuette was
modelled after it, which enjoyed a large sale.</p>

<p>His ideas of female beauty were almost as eccentric as those
of Cruikshank. A couple of beauties of the Meadows type will
be found at page 3 of Henry Cockton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sisters&rdquo; (Nodes, 1844),
where one lady is represented to us with a neck like that of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>362</span>
giraffe, whilst her sister beauty is sensibly inconvenienced by a lock
of hair which has strayed into her eye,&mdash;a favourite device, by the
way, of the artist. This book, now scarce (in the illustration of
which he was assisted by Alfred Crowquill), is adorned with a
portrait on steel, after a painting by Childe, in which the author
is presented to us in a white waistcoat and dress coat, with a pen
in his hand, leading us to the inference that his clumsily constructed
novels (one of which&mdash;&ldquo;Valentine Vox,&rdquo; thanks perhaps to the illustrator,
Onwhyn&mdash;still holds its ground) were written in evening
costume.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding these failures, Kenny Meadows has happily
left behind him work of a very much better kind. His Christmas
pictures in particular are impressed with the kindly, genial humour
which characterized the man; the &ldquo;Illuminated Magazine,&rdquo; a scarce
and valuable work, contains sixty-three very fine specimens of his
pencillings, including the illustrations to his friend Douglas Jerrold&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Chronicles of Clovernook,&rdquo; admirable in every respect, probably
the finest designs he ever executed. The wood engravings in this
charming serial have probably never been surpassed; we seldom
see woodcuts in these days which equal the splendid workmanship
of E. Landells.<a name="FnAnchor_178" href="#Footnote_178"><span class="sp">178</span></a> After the third volume, the &ldquo;Illuminated
Magazine&rdquo; passed into other hands, and although Kenny Meadows
continued its mainstay for a time, the rest of the excellent artists
left, and the literary matter visibly declined.</p>

<p>To the famous &ldquo;Gallery of Comicalities&rdquo; Kenny Meadows
contributed <i>Sketches from Lavater</i> and <i>Phisogs of the Traders
of London</i>. During the last decade of his life his services in the
cause of illustrative art were rewarded and recognised by a
pension from the Civil List of £80 per annum. Like George
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page363" id="page363"></a>363</span>
Cruikshank he remained hale and vigorous to the last, proud of
his age, and fond of asserting there was &ldquo;life in the old dog yet.&rdquo;
That this was no idle boast may be inferred from the fact that within
a few months of his death he was engaged in painting a subject
from his favourite Shakespeare. At the time of his death (in
August, 1874) he had almost completed his eighty-fifth year.</p>

<p class="center1" style="letter-spacing: 3em;">******</p>

<p>In hunting up materials for the present work, we have come at
various times upon editions (specimens, perhaps, might be the
better word) of the &ldquo;Pickwick Papers,&rdquo; which will possess an interest
in the eyes of the collector. The first issue, in the original green
sporting covers designed by Seymour, is of course exceedingly
scarce; we have never indeed seen a <i>perfect</i> copy, which would
probably be worth some ten pounds, while the same edition bound
may be purchased at prices varying from twenty-four shillings to
three guineas, according to the condition of the volume. An Australian
edition was published at Launceston, Van Dieman&rsquo;s Land,
in 1838, with plates after &ldquo;Phiz&rdquo; by &ldquo;Tiz,&rdquo; facsimiles on stone of
the earliest issue of the parts in England. At a West of England
bookseller&rsquo;s we met with a first edition bound up with etchings
by Onwhyn,<a name="FnAnchor_179" href="#Footnote_179"><span class="sp">179</span></a> &ldquo;Peter Palette,&rdquo; and others. Then there are the
twenty-four etchings from remarkably clever original drawings by
Mr. F. W. Pailthorpe in illustration of scenes in &ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; of
which the proofs before letters were published at three guineas;
and lastly, there is the rare first edition, containing all the plates
by Seymour and &ldquo;Phiz,&rdquo; supplemented by the two &ldquo;suppressed&rdquo;
etchings, which are credited (wrongly) to the hand of Buss.</p>

<p>Among the etchers of book illustration after 1836, we may name
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page364" id="page364"></a>364</span>
<span class="sc">Robert William Buss</span>, whose etchings will be found in Mrs.
Trollope&rsquo;s &ldquo;Widow Married&rdquo; (a sequel to her &ldquo;Widow Barnaby&rdquo;),
which made its appearance in the &ldquo;New Monthly Magazine&rdquo; of 1839,
and whose hand will also be found in Marryat&rsquo;s &ldquo;Peter Simple,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Jacob Faithful,&rdquo; Harrison Ainsworth&rsquo;s &ldquo;Court of King James II.,&rdquo;
etc. Although his designs lack the genius, the artistic power, the
finish and the comic invention of Leech or Cruikshank, they show
nevertheless that as an etcher and designer he was possessed of
exceptional talent and ability. The first experience, however, of
this able artist as an etcher was peculiarly unfortunate and vexatious.</p>

<p>When poor Seymour shot himself in 1836, the draughtsman first
called in to supply his place was Robert William Buss. He had
been recommended to Messrs. Chapman and Hall by John
Jackson, the wood-engraver, but does not seem at that time to have
had any practical experience of etching, as he himself explained
to the member of the firm who called upon him. Mr. Buss, in
fact, was decidedly indisposed to undertake the work, being then
engaged on a picture he was preparing for exhibition, and he undertook
it only after considerable pressure. He immediately began
to practise the various operations of etching and biting in, and
produced a plate with which the publishers expressed themselves
satisfied. Two subjects were then selected for illustration, <i>The
Cricket Match</i>, and <i>The Fat Boy Watching Mr. Tupman and Miss
Wardle</i>. When, however, Mr. Buss began to etch them on the
plate, he found, having had little or no experience in laying his
ground, that it holed up under the etching point; and as time was
precious, he placed the plates in the hands of an experienced
engraver to be etched and bitten in. Had opportunity been given
him, his son (from whom we take this account) tells us he would
have cancelled these plates and issued fresh ones of his own etching.
Designs were prepared by him for the following number, when he
received an intimation that the work of illustrating the &ldquo;Pickwick
Papers&rdquo; had been placed in other hands. The illustrations referred
to were suppressed, and the collectors who are so anxious to secure
an edition with the two &ldquo;Buss plates,&rdquo; will be pleased to learn that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id="page365"></a>365</span>
although the design was his, not one line of the etchings which
bear his name are due to the artist&rsquo;s point.<a name="FnAnchor_180" href="#Footnote_180"><span class="sp">180</span></a></p>

<p>The father of Robert William was an engraver and enameller,
and under his directions he acquired a knowledge of this technical
branch of art; but evincing a taste and preference for drawing
and painting, he became a pupil of George Clint, A.R.A., under
whose direction he studied subject and portrait painting. He
painted fifteen theatrical portraits for Mr. Cumberland in illustration
of his &ldquo;British Drama,&rdquo; and a collection of these works was afterwards
exhibited at that melancholy monument to past exhibitions,
the Colosseum in the Regent&rsquo;s Park. He was employed by Charles
Knight in the illustrations to his &ldquo;Shakespeare,&rdquo; &ldquo;London,&rdquo; &ldquo;Old
England,&rdquo; &ldquo;Chaucer,&rdquo; and the now forgotten &ldquo;Penny Magazine,&rdquo;
for all of which publications he executed many designs on wood.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed because Robert William Buss was not
considered the right man to illustrate &ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; that he was
therefore an indifferent draughtsman. His finest book etchings are
probably those which he executed for Harrison Ainsworth&rsquo;s novel
of &ldquo;The Court of James II.&rdquo;; but in a higher and far more ambitious
walk in art he was not only more successful, but achieved
in his time a considerable reputation. Among his pictures may be
mentioned one of <i>Christmas in the Olden Time</i>, which, apart from
its merits as a painting, showed that he possessed considerable
antiquarian knowledge. Other works of his are, <i>The Frosty Morning</i>,
purchased by Lord Charles Townshend; <i>The Stingy Traveller</i>,
bought by the Duchess of St. Albans; <i>The Wooden Walls of Old
England</i>, the property of Lord Coventry; <i>Soliciting a Vote</i>, and
<i>Chairing the Member</i>; <i>The Musical Bore</i>; <i>The Frosty Reception</i>;
<i>Master&rsquo;s Out</i>; <i>Time and Tide Wait for no Man</i>; <i>Shirking the Plate</i>;
<i>The First of September</i>; <i>The Introduction of Tobacco</i>; <i>The Biter
Bit</i>; <i>The Romance</i>; and <i>Satisfaction</i>. For Mr. Hogarth, of the
Haymarket, he painted four small subjects illustrative of Christmas,
entitled, <i>The Waits</i>; <i>Bringing in the Boar&rsquo;s Head</i>; <i>The Yule Log</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page366" id="page366"></a>366</span>
and <i>The Wassail Bowl</i>; all afterwards engraved. For Mr. James
Haywood, M.P., he executed a series of drawings illustrative of
student life at Oxford, Cambridge, Durham, London, and Paris;
while two vast subjects, <i>The Origin of Music</i> and <i>The Triumph of
Music</i> (each twenty feet wide by nine feet high), were painted for
the Earl of Hardwick, and are, or lately were, in the music saloon
at Wimpole, in Cambridgeshire. His pictures were seventy-one in
number, twenty-five of which were engraved. On the whole, therefore,
Robert William Buss might afford to bear the refusal of Charles
Dickens&rsquo;s patronage with equanimity.</p>

<p>The paintings and etchings of Robert William Buss evince a
strong leaning in the direction of comic art, a taste which prompted
him, in 1853, to deliver at various towns in the United Kingdom
a course of very successful and interesting lectures on caricature
and graphic satire, illustrated by several hundred examples executed
by himself. In 1874, the year before his death, he published for
the amusement of his friends, and for private circulation only, the
substance of these lectures, under the title of &ldquo;English Graphic
Satire and its Relation to Different Styles of Painting, Sculpture,
and Engraving.&rdquo; The numerous illustrations to this work were
those drawn for his lectures by the artist, and reproduced for his
book by the process of photo-lithography. So far as comic art and
caricaturists of the nineteenth century are concerned, the author
has comparatively little to say; but the work is valuable as regards
the subject generally, and might have been published with advantage
to the public. The artist delivered also lectures on &ldquo;The Beautiful
and the Picturesque,&rdquo; as well as on &ldquo;Fresco Painting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Buss, if not very original as a comic designer, possessed
nevertheless a keen sense of humour. One of his pictures (engraved
by H. Rolls), entitled <i>Time and Tide Wait for no Man</i>, represents
an artist, sketching by the sea-shore, so absorbed in the contemplation
of nature that he remains unconscious of the fast inflowing
tide, and deaf to the warnings of the fisherman who is seen hailing
him from the beach.</p>

<p class="center1" style="letter-spacing: 3em;">******</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id="page367"></a>367</span></p>

<p>The comic publications which either preceded or ran side by side
with <i>Punch</i> had for the most part a somewhat short and unsatisfactory
career. Perhaps the most successful of them was <i>Figaro
in London</i>, 1831-36, which we have already noticed. <i>The Wag</i>, a
long-forgotten publication, enjoyed a very transient existence. In
1832 appeared <i>Punchinello</i>, on the pages of which Isaac Robert
Cruikshank was engaged. <i>Punchinello</i>, however, ceased running
after its tenth number. <i>Asmodeus in London</i>, notwithstanding the
support it derived from Seymour&rsquo;s pencil, was by no means a commercial
success. <i>The Devil in London</i> was a little more fortunate.
This periodical commenced running on the 29th of February, 1832,
and the illustrations of Isaac Robert Cruikshank and Kenny
Meadows enabled it to reach its thirty-seventh number. Tom
Dibdin&rsquo;s <i>Penny Trumpet</i> ignominiously blew itself out after the
fourth number.  <i>The Schoolmaster at Home</i>, notwithstanding
Seymour&rsquo;s graphic exertions, collapsed at its sixth number. <i>The
Whig Dresser</i>, illustrated by Heath, enjoyed an existence exactly
of twelve numbers. <i>The Squib</i> (1842) lasted for thirty weeks before
it exploded and went out. <i>Puck</i> (1848), illustrated by W. Hine,
Kenny Meadows, and Gilbert, died the twenty-fifth week after its
first publication. <i>Chat</i> ran its course in 1850 and 1851. <i>The Man
in the Moon</i>, under the literary guidance of Shirley Brooks, Albert
Smith, G. A. Sala, and the Brothers Brough, enjoyed a comparatively
glorious career of two years and a half. <i>Diogenes</i> (started in 1853,
under the literary conduct of Watts Phillips, the Broughs, Halliday,
and Angus Bethune Reach), notwithstanding the graphic help
rendered by McConnell<a name="FnAnchor_181" href="#Footnote_181"><span class="sp">181</span></a> and Charles H. Bennett, gave up the
ghost in 1854. <i>Punchinello</i> (second of the name) flickered and
went out at the seventh number. <i>Judy</i> (the predecessor of the
present paper) appeared 1st February, 1843, but soon died a
natural death. <i>Town Talk</i>, edited by Halliday and illustrated by
McConnell, lasted a very limited time. <i>London</i>, started by George
Augustus Sala in rivalry of <i>Punch</i>, soon ceased running; while the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>368</span>
<i>Puppet Show</i>, notwithstanding the ability of Mr. Procter, enjoyed
but a very brief and transitory existence. The strong and healthy
constitution of <i>Punch</i> enabled him not only to outlive all these, but
even a publication superior in some important respects to himself.
We allude to the <i>Tomahawk</i>, whose cartoons are certainly the most
powerful and outspoken satires which have appeared since the
days of Gillray.<a name="FnAnchor_182" href="#Footnote_182"><span class="sp">182</span></a></p>

<p>Among the draughtsmen whom <i>Punch</i> called in to help him in his
early days was a useful and ingenious artist, inferior in many respects
to Kenny Meadows, his name was <span class="sc">Alfred Henry Forrester</span>,
better known to most of us under his <i>nom de guerre</i> of &ldquo;Alfred
Crowquill.&rdquo; The scribes of the &ldquo;Catnach,&rdquo; or Seven Dials school,
of literature are satirized by Forrester (in the second volume),
wherein we see a &ldquo;Literary Gentleman&rdquo; hard at work at his vocation
of a scribe of cheap and deleterious literature, consulting his authorities&mdash;&ldquo;The
Annals of Crime,&rdquo; a &ldquo;Last Dying Speech and Confession,&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Newgate Calendar.&rdquo; In <i>The Footman</i> we have
a gorgeous figure, adorned with epaulets, lace, and a cocked hat,
reading (of all things in the world) the &ldquo;Loves of the Angels,&rdquo; over
a bottle of hock and soda-water! <i>The Pursuit of Matrimony under
Difficulties</i> is a more ambitious performance. &ldquo;Punch&rsquo;s Guide to the
Watering Places&rdquo; (vol. iii.) is illustrated with a number of coarsely
executed cuts, wholly destitute of merit; the fourth volume contains
a cartoon entitled <i>Private Opinions</i>. But the graphic humour
of Alfred Crowquill, although amusing and sometimes bright and
sparkling, was unsuited to the requirements of a periodical such as
<i>Punch</i>. As better men came forward, he gradually dropped out of
its pages, and we see nothing more of him after the fourth volume.</p>

<p>&ldquo;SWEARING THE HORNS&rdquo; AT HIGHGATE.</p>

<p class="al">&ldquo;When any person passed through Highgate for the first time on his way to London, he, being
brought before the horns, had a mock oath administered to him, to the effect that he would never
drink small beer when he could get strong, unless he liked it better; that he would never eat brown
bread when he could get white, or water-gruel, when he could command turtle-soup; that he would
never make love to the maid when he might to the mistress; and so on &emsp;.&emsp; according to the wit
of the imposer of the oath, and simplicity of the oath-taker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alfred Crowquill was a sort of &ldquo;general utility&rdquo; man, essaying the
character of a <i>littérateur</i> as well as that of an artist, and achieving
as a natural consequence no permanent success in either. In his
literary capacity, Alfred Henry Forrester made his first appearance
(we believe) in &ldquo;The Hive,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Mirror,&rdquo; under the editorship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id="page369"></a>369</span>
of Mr. Timbs; while as an artist he illustrated his own writings,
besides those of a host of other authors. An early effort of his
pencil is entitled, <i>Der Freyschutz Travestied</i>; this was followed by
&ldquo;Alfred Crowquill&rsquo;s Sketch Books,&rdquo; which were dedicated to the
(then) Princess Victoria, by command of the Duchess of Kent. We
find him afterwards employed on the pages of the &ldquo;New Monthly,&rdquo;
but on the death of its editor, Mr. Theodore Hook, his useful talents
procured him an engagement on the staff of &ldquo;Bentley&rsquo;s Miscellany,&rdquo;
to whose pages he was not only an indefatigable contributor, but
rendered it substantial assistance in its difficulties with George
Cruikshank. The best of his illustrative works (mostly designs on
wood) were executed for this periodical, and selections were afterwards
collected and published under the title of &ldquo;The Phantasmagoria
of Fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In these days a man like Forrester would be almost at a discount,
but at the time when he started there was less competition, and
a useful, clever man, like he undoubtedly was, was fortunately not
lost. His hands, in fact, were always full, and a list of some of
the books to which his pen and his pencil contributed will be found
in the Appendix. One of the best of his designs was a title-page
he executed for a work published by Kent &amp; Co., under the title of
&ldquo;Merry Pictures by the Comic Hands of Alfred Crowquill, Doyle,
Meadows, Hine, and Others&rdquo; (1857), a <i>réchauffage</i> of cuts and illustrations
which had previously done duty for books of an ephemeral
character, such as &ldquo;The Gent,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Ballet Girl,&rdquo; and even of
the superior order of &ldquo;Gavarni in London.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_183" href="#Footnote_183"><span class="sp">183</span></a> Some excellent
designs executed by him on wood will be found in Messrs. Chambers&rsquo;
&ldquo;Book of Days.&rdquo; In his dual character of a writer and comic artist,
Crowquill was an inveterate punster. Leaves from his &ldquo;Memorandum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page370" id="page370"></a>370</span>
Book&rdquo; (1834) will give us a good idea of his style. In &ldquo;Tea Leaves
for Breakfast,&rdquo; <i>Strong Black</i> is represented by a sturdy negro carrying
a heavy basket; a tall youth with a small father personating <i>Hyson</i>;
a housemaid shaking a hall mat, to the discomfort of herself and
the passers-by, is labelled <i>Fine dust</i>; a cockney accidentally discharging
his fowling-piece does duty for <i>Gunpowder</i>; while <i>Mixed</i>
is aptly personified by a curious group of masqueraders. The vowels
put in a comical appearance: <i>A</i> with his hands behind him listens
to <i>E</i>, who points to <i>I</i> as the subject of his remarks, which must be
of a scandalous character, as the injured vowel looks the picture of
anger and astonishment. <i>E</i> finds a ready listener in <i>O</i>, who opens
his mouth and extends his hands in real or simulated amazement
and horror.</p>

<p>Crowquill was a clever caricaturist, and began work when he
was only eighteen. We have seen some able satires of his executed
between the years 1823 and 1826 inclusive. One of the best,
published by S. Knight in 1825, is entitled, <i>Paternal Pride</i>: &ldquo;Dear
Doctor, don&rsquo;t you think my little Billy is like me?&rdquo; &ldquo;The very
picture of you in every feature!&rdquo; <i>Ups and Downs</i> (Knights, 1823),
comprise &ldquo;Take Up&rdquo; (a Bow Street runner); &ldquo;Speak Up&rdquo; (a
barrister); &ldquo;Hang Up&rdquo; (a hangman); &ldquo;Let-em-Down&rdquo; (a coachman);
&ldquo;Knock-em-Down&rdquo; (an auctioneer); &ldquo;Screw-em-Down&rdquo;
(an undertaker). The following are given as <i>Four Specimens of the
Reading Public</i> (Fairburn, 1826): &ldquo;Romancing Molly,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir Lacey
Luscious,&rdquo; a &ldquo;Political Dustman,&rdquo; and &ldquo;French à la Mode.&rdquo; Two,
in which he was assisted by George Cruikshank, entitled, <i>Indigestion</i>,
and <i>Jealousy</i>, will be found in the volume published (and republished)
under the name of &ldquo;Cruikshankiana.&rdquo; The latter shows on the face
of it that, while Crowquill was responsible for the design, the etching
and a large share of the invention are due to Cruikshank.</p>

<p>If not a genius, the man was talented and clever,&mdash;a universal
favourite. He could draw, he could write; he was an admirable
vocalist, setting the table in a roar with his medley of songs. Even
as a painter he was favourably known. <i>Temperance and Intemperance</i>
were engraved from his painting in oils, and called forth a letter of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page371" id="page371"></a>371</span>
thanks from the great apostle of temperance, Father Mathew himself.
Other works were <i>The Ups and Downs of Life</i>, the well-known
<i>President</i> and <i>Vice President</i> (both engraved), and many others. A
clever artist in &ldquo;black and white,&rdquo; two of his pen-and-ink sketches&mdash;<i>The
Huntsman&rsquo;s Rest</i> and <i>The Solitary</i>&mdash;were honoured with a
place among the drawings at the Royal Academy Exhibition of 1846.
His talents did not end here; most of the Christmas pantomimes of
his time were indebted to him for clever designs, devices, and effects.
The kindly, genial, gifted man died in 1872, in his sixty-eighth year.</p>

<p class="center1" style="letter-spacing: 3em;">******</p>

<p>Some of our readers may possibly remember seeing in one of
the comic publications published concurrently with or shortly after
the appearance of Mr. Charles Darwin&rsquo;s work, a series of comical
designs ridiculing the theory of the &ldquo;origin of species&rdquo; in a manner
which must have astonished as well as amused the learned philosopher.
The origin of the genus <i>footman</i>, and of the dish he carries to
his master&rsquo;s table, is traced out as follows: The dish carries a bone,
which eventually finds its way into the jaws of a mongrel cur with a
peculiarly short tail. The process then goes merrily onwards; the
dog gradually develops; his skin turns into a suit of livery with
buttons, the dog-collar gradually assumes the form of a footman&rsquo;s
tie, until the process is ended and the species complete. In like
manner, a cat develops into a spinster aunt; a monkey into a mischievous
urchin; a pig into a gourmand; a sheep into a country
bumpkin; a weasel into a lawyer; a dancing bear into a garrotter;
a shark into a money-lender; a snail into the schoolboy to which
Shakespeare likens him; a fish into a toper, and so on. These
&ldquo;developments&rdquo; (twenty in number), which were dedicated to Mr.
Darwin, are signed &ldquo;C. H. B.&rdquo; and these are the initials of <span class="sc">Charles
H. Bennett</span>, one of the gentlest, most promising, and withal most
original graphic humourists of the century.</p>

<p>Amongst the earliest of the serials which he illustrated was, we
believe, <i>Diogenes</i>, a sort of rival of <i>Punch</i>, which made its appearance
and ran a brief course in 1853-4. Associated with him in the illustrations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372"></a>372</span>
were McConnell and Watts Phillips, the latter of whom contributed
largely also to the literary matter. We find a clever design
of his (in Leech&rsquo;s style) in the second volume: &ldquo;Now, gentlemen of
the jury,&rdquo; says a brazen-faced barrister, &ldquo;I throw myself upon your
impartial judgment as husbands and fathers, and I confidently ask,
Does the prisoner [the most murderous-looking ruffian un-hung] look
like a man who would knock down and trample upon the wife of
his bosom? Gentlemen, I have done!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was considerable originality in the designs of Bennett, which
is more particularly manifested in the well-known series of humorous
sketches in which the effect intended to be produced is effected by
means of the <i>shadows</i> of the figures represented, which are supposed
to indicate their distinguishing failings and characteristics. Among
them may be mentioned a tipsy woman amused at the <i>shadow</i> cast
by her own figure of a gin bottle; an undertaker, in his garb of woe
wrung from the pockets of widows and orphans, casts the appropriate
shadow of a crocodile; a red-nosed old hospital nurse of a tea-pot;
a worn-out seamstress of a skeleton; a mischievous street boy
of a monkey; an angry wife sitting up for a truant husband of an
extinguisher; a tall, conceited-looking parson, with a long coat, of a
pump; while a sweep, with his &ldquo;machine,&rdquo; to his mortal terror beholds
his own shadow preceding him in the guise of Beelzebub himself.
The series is continued in a work published by W. Kent &amp; Co.
in 1860, under the title of &ldquo;Shadow and Substance,&rdquo; the letterpress
of which is contributed to Bennett&rsquo;s pictures by Robert B. Brough.
Literary work of this description, like William Combe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Doctor
Syntax,&rdquo; is necessarily unsatisfactory; but the pictures themselves
are distinctly inferior to the series which preceded them, the best
being <i>Old Enough to Know Better</i>,&mdash;a bald-headed, superannuated
old sinner behind the scenes, presenting a bouquet to a ballet girl,
his figure casting a <i>shadow</i> on the back of the scene of a bearded,
long-eared, horned old goat.</p>

<p>We are in no position to give a detailed list of Charles Bennett&rsquo;s
work, which was of a very miscellaneous kind, comprising among
others a series of slight outline portraits of members of parliament,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page373" id="page373"></a>373</span>
which appeared in the <i>Illustrated Times</i>, an edition of the
&ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rdquo; edited by the Rev. Charles Kingsley; &ldquo;John
Todd,&rdquo; a work by the Rev. John Allen; &ldquo;Shadows,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Shadow
and Substance,&rdquo; just spoken of; &ldquo;Proverbs, with Pictures by
Charles H. Bennett,&rdquo; etc., etc. His talent at last attracted the
notice of the weekly <i>Punch</i> council, and he received the coveted
distinction of being engaged on the permanent staff of that
periodical.</p>

<p>His life, however, was a brief one. The diary of Shirley Brooks,
who took much personal interest in him, refers with some anxiety to
his illness on the 30th of March, 1867. On the 31st of March the
report was somewhat more favourable; but the 2nd of April brought
a letter from the editor of <i>Punch</i>, Mark Lemon, which said that
Charles Bennett had died between the hours of eight and nine
o&rsquo;clock that morning. &ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; adds Shirley Brooks in
an autograph note appended beneath the letter referred to. &ldquo;B[ennett]
was a man whom one could not help loving for his gentleness,
and a wonderful artist.&rdquo; The obituary notice by the same hand
which appears in <i>Punch</i> records that &ldquo;he was a very able colleague,
a very dear friend. None of our fellow-workers,&rdquo; it continues, &ldquo;ever
entered more heartily into his work, or laboured with more earnestness
to promote our general purpose. His facile execution and
singular subtilty of fancy were, we hoped, destined to enrich these
pages for many a year. It has been willed otherwise, and we lament
the loss of a comrade of invaluable skill, and the death of one of the
kindliest and gentlest of our associates, the power of whose hand
was equalled by the goodness of his heart.&rdquo; Charles Bennett was
only thirty-seven when he died.</p>

<p>He left a widow and eight children unprovided for, for his health
having precluded it, no life insurance had been effected. The
<i>Punch</i> men, however, with the unselfishness which so nobly characterizes
them, put their shoulders to the wheel for the family of their
stricken comrade. &ldquo;We shall have to do something,&rdquo; said Shirley
Brooks in his diary of the 3rd of April; and they did it accordingly.
A committee was immediately started, on which we find the names of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page374" id="page374"></a>374</span>
Messrs. Arthur Lewis,<a name="FnAnchor_184" href="#Footnote_184"><span class="sp">184</span></a> Wilbert Beale, Mark Lemon, Du Maurier,
John Tenniel, Arthur Sullivan, and W. H. Bradbury. Then came
rehearsals, and, on the 11th of May, a performance at the Adelphi in
aid of the Bennett fund. Mr. Arthur Sullivan had, in conjunction
with Mr. F. C. Burnand, converted the well-known farce of &ldquo;Box
and Cox&rdquo; into an operetta of the most ludicrous description. This
was the opening piece&mdash;the forerunner of &ldquo;Pinafore,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pirates,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Patience,&rdquo; and other triumphs. Arthur Sullivan himself conducted,
and the players were Mr. Du Maurier, Mr. Quinton, and Mr. Arthur
Blunt. Then followed &ldquo;A Sheep in Wolf&rsquo;s Clothing,&rdquo; in which
Mesdames Kate Terry, Florence Terry, Mrs. Stoker, Mrs. Watts
(the present Ellen Terry), and Messrs. Mark Lemon, Tom Taylor,
Tenniel, Burnand, Silver, Pritchett, and Horace Mayhew took part.
This was succeeded by Offenbach&rsquo;s &ldquo;Blind Beggars,&rdquo; who were
admirably personated by Mr. Du Maurier and Mr. Harold Power.
The evening concluded with a number of part songs and madrigals
sung by the Moray Minstrels&mdash;so called from their chiefly performing
at Moray Lodge, the residence of Mr. Arthur Lewis. Between the
two portions of their entertainment, Shirley Brooks came on and
delivered an address written by himself, which contained the following
allusion to him for whose family the generous work had been
undertaken:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center1" style="letter-spacing: 3em;">******</p>

<p>The <i>Punch</i> volumes, prior to his withdrawal from its pages, are
interspersed with numerous mirth-provoking drawings on wood by
the late Mr. <span class="sc">Thackeray</span>. Probably the best of these will be found
in the &ldquo;Novels by Eminent Hands,&rdquo; in one of which (in amusing
burlesque of <i>Phiz&rsquo;s</i> spirited title-page to &ldquo;Charles O&rsquo;Malley&rdquo;) we
see the hero flying over the heads of the French army. Charles
Lever was nervously sensitive to ridicule, and, although he laughed
at and enjoyed the clever <i>jeux d&rsquo;esprit</i> in which &ldquo;Phil Fogarty,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Harry Jolly-cur,&rdquo; &ldquo;Harry Rollicker,&rdquo; etc., put in their respective
appearances, he declared nevertheless, with evident vexation, that
he himself might just as well retire from business altogether. This,
indeed, he proceeded to do; and although we miss from that time
the rattling heroes of the Frank Webber and Charles O&rsquo;Malley
school, we are indebted to Thackeray for the striking proof which
Charles Lever was thus enabled to afford us of the versatility of a
genius which enabled him to change front and alter his style with
manifest advantage to his literary reputation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page376" id="page376"></a>376</span></p>

<p>The fact of his waiting upon Dickens at his chambers in Furnival&rsquo;s
Inn &ldquo;with two or three drawings in his hand, which strange to say
he did not find suitable&rdquo; for &ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; has been told so often
that there is no occasion for repeating it again; but the circumstances
under which he seems to have sought the interview not being, so far
as we know, stated anywhere, we shall now proceed to relate <span class="correction" title="Comma after 'them' changed to period">them.</span>
Thackeray was in London when Seymour shot himself in 1836. The
death of the latter caused a vacancy in the post of illustrator to
&ldquo;Figaro in London,&rdquo; which at that time Seymour was illustrating as
well as &ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; and such vacancy was supplied by Thackeray,
who, I think, continued to illustrate it until the paper died a natural
death. His designs for &ldquo;Figaro in London&rdquo; were drawn in pen and
ink on paper, and transferred to the wood by the engravers, Messrs.
Branstone and Wright, and the remuneration he received for them
was very trifling, at most a few shillings each. It was probably this
circumstance which put into his head the idea of illustrating &ldquo;Pickwick.&rdquo;
From what we know of the graphic abilities of Thackeray
and the fastidious requirements of Dickens, we may readily understand
why the post rendered vacant by Seymour&rsquo;s suicide was given
to an abler artist.</p>

<p>We wish that from a work dealing with comic art in the nineteenth
century the name of Mr. Thackeray might be omitted; for no notice
of him, however short, would be just or complete which failed to
refer to his book illustrations. To do this we must separate
Thackeray the artist from Thackeray the man of letters. Regarding
him simply in the character of illustrator of the novels of W. M.
Thackeray, we are bound in justice to the memory of that great
and sterling humourist, to say that he has undertaken a task which
is manifestly beyond his powers. While Thackeray with his <i>pen</i>
could most effectively describe a fascinating woman, like Becky
Sharp, the illusion vanishes the moment his artist essays to draw her
portrait with his pencil. While Thackeray&rsquo;s women are pretty and
fascinating, well dressed and accomplished, the artist&rsquo;s women on the
contrary are hideous; their waists commence somewhere in the
region of their knees; and their clothes look as if they had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page377" id="page377"></a>377</span>
piled on their back with a pitchfork. The same remarks apply to
the men; while the originals are witty or clever, handsome or well-dressed,
those presented to us by the artist are destitute of calf, and
their limbs so curiously constructed that the free use of them as
nature intended would be a matter of utter impossibility. Those
defects are the more noticeable because the artist has shown in his
admirable essays on George Cruikshank and John Leech how
thoroughly he was alive to the possession of artistic genius in
others.</p>

<p>The admiration which we have for Thackeray the man of letters,
and the way in which we have already expressed that admiration,
render it unlikely that the drift of these remarks will be misunderstood.
While rejoicing that the admirable tales and satires of the
humourist are uninjured by illustrations which are altogether
unworthy of them, we venture to suggest how much better the result
might have been had the latter been entrusted, as in the case of
&ldquo;The Newcomes,&rdquo; to other hands, and the artist contented himself
with the initial letters and designs on wood with which his writings
are pleasantly interspersed. We have seen it somewhere stated
(we think in the volume entitled &ldquo;Thackerayana&rdquo;) that the author&rsquo;s
rapid facility of sketching was the one great impediment to his
attainment of excellence in illustrative art. Some of his designs
indeed bear on their face evidence of the rapidity with which they
were thrown off; but no satisfactory explanation appears to be
possible of his contempt for what Mr. Hodder has termed the
&ldquo;practical laws which regulate the academic exercise of the pictorial
art,&rdquo; and his apparent ignorance of the art of balancing his figures so
as to enable them to stand upright, to walk straight, or to move their
limbs with the grace and freedom assigned to them by nature. One
of the designs to &ldquo;The Virginians&rdquo; shows a horseman, who in the
letterpress is described as crossing a bridge at full gallop, whereas
in the picture both man and horse will inevitably leap over the
parapet into the river below. Nothing could possibly avert the catastrophe,
and the effect thus produced is due, not to the manifest
carelessness and haste with which the sketch is thrown off, but to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378"></a>378</span>
palpable defect in the artistic powers of the designer himself. Yet
in the face of defects so patent and so palpable we have found it
gravely stated, &ldquo;The world which is loth to admit high excellence
in more than one direction, has never fitly recognised <i>Thackeray&rsquo;s
great gift as a comic draftsman</i>. Here [<i>i.e.</i> in a work edited by his
daughter] he will be found advantageously represented; inferior,
it is true to the unjustly neglected Hablot Browne (&rsquo;Phiz&rsquo;), <i>but
often equalling if not sometimes surpassing the greatly over-rated John
Leech</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ay! &ldquo;the world <i>is</i> loth to admit high excellence in more than one
direction,&rdquo; and experience has taught it that few men, however gifted,
are capable of exercising two different arts with an equal measure
of success. Thackeray was both a genius and an artist, but
the world has long recognised the fact that the former manifested
itself only when he laid down the pencil and took up the pen. If
called on to <i>prove</i> his incapacity to illustrate his own work, we will
refer the reader to his admirable novel of &ldquo;Vanity Fair.&rdquo; The time
selected for the story is the early part of the present century; and
on the plea that he had &ldquo;not the heart to disfigure his heroes and
heroines&rdquo; by the correct but &ldquo;hideous&rdquo; costumes of the period,
Thackeray has actually habited these men and women of 1815 in
the dress of 1848! Cruikshank, Leech, &ldquo;Phiz,&rdquo; or Doyle, it is
unnecessary to say, would have been guiltless of such an absurdity;
and the difficulty in which the gifted author found himself, and the
confession of his inability to cope with it, afford the clearest possible
evidence of his utter incapacity to illustrate the story itself. If any
further proof be wanted, look at the designs themselves. Captain
Dobbin would be laughed out of any European military service;
such a guardsman as Rawdon Crawley could find no place in her
Majesty&rsquo;s guards; &ldquo;Jemima&rdquo; (at p. 7), &ldquo;Miss Sharp in the schoolroom&rdquo;
(p. 80), the children waiting on Miss Crawley (p. 89), the
figures in the fencing scene (p. 207), &ldquo;The Family Party at Brighton,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Gloriana&rdquo; trying her fascinations on the major, &ldquo;Jos&rdquo; (at p. 569),
and &ldquo;Becky&rsquo;s second appearance as Clytemnestra,&rdquo; without meaning
to be so, are caricatures pure and simple; and yet these are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page379" id="page379"></a>379</span>
admirable compared with the designs to &ldquo;The Virginians,&rdquo; which
may safely be reckoned amongst the worst in the entire range of
English illustrative art. Contrast them with illustrations confessedly
not up to the severe standard of excellence required by the art
critic, but admirably adapted for their purpose, Mr. Doyle&rsquo;s etchings
to &ldquo;The Newcomes,&rdquo; and remark the immeasurable superiority of
the latter.</p>

<p>And yet, in justice to the great humourist of the nineteenth
century, let us hear what another great writer has to say upon the
very illustrations which seem to us to call for such severe animadversion.
After telling us that Thackeray studied drawing at Paris,
affecting especially Bonnington (the young English artist who died
in 1828), Mr. Anthony Trollope goes on to say, &ldquo;He never learned
to draw,&mdash;perhaps never could have learned. That he was idle and
did not do his best, we may take for granted. He was always idle,
and only on some occasions, when the spirit moved him thoroughly,
did he do his best even in after life. But with drawing&mdash;or rather
without it&mdash;he did wonderfully well, even when he did his worst.
He did illustrate his own books, and every one knows how incorrect
were his delineations. But as illustrations they were excellent.
How often have I wished that characters of my creating might be
sketched as faultily, if with the same appreciation of the intended
purpose. Let any one look at the &lsquo;plates,&rsquo; as they are called,
in &lsquo;Vanity Fair,&rsquo; and compare each with the scenes and the
characters intended to be displayed, and then see whether the artist&mdash;if
we may call him so&mdash;has not managed to convey in the picture
the exact feeling which he has described in the text. I have a
little sketch of his, in which a cannon-ball is supposed to have just
carried off the head of an aide-de-camp,&mdash;messenger I had perhaps
better say, lest I might affront military feelings,&mdash;who is kneeling on
the field of battle and delivering a despatch to Marlborough on
horseback. The graceful ease with which the duke receives the
message though the messenger&rsquo;s head be gone, and the soldierlike
precision with which the headless hero finishes his last effort of
military obedience, may not have been portrayed with well-drawn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page380" id="page380"></a>380</span>
figures, but no finished illustration ever told its story better.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_185" href="#Footnote_185"><span class="sp">185</span></a>
We read these remarks with profound astonishment, and can only
ask in reply: If, as Mr. Trollope has admitted, Thackeray &ldquo;never
learned to draw,&mdash;perhaps never could have learned,&rdquo; how he could
manage &ldquo;to convey&rdquo; in any of his pictures &ldquo;the exact feeling he
has described in the text&rdquo;?&mdash;how, in the face of the admitted
incorrectness of &ldquo;his delineations,&rdquo; he could be in any way fitted to
illustrate a novel of such transcendent excellence as &ldquo;Vanity Fair&rdquo;?</p>

<p>It has been assumed, without any sort of authority, that it was
only when Thackeray found he could not succeed as an artist that
he turned to literature. The statement is altogether unwarranted.
At or about the very time he was engaged in drawing the cuts for
&ldquo;Figaro in London,&rdquo; he was&mdash;if we are to judge of the sketch of
&ldquo;the Fraserians&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Maclise Portrait Gallery,&rdquo; in which young
Thackeray may easily be recognised&mdash;writing for &ldquo;Fraser&rsquo;s Magazine.&rdquo;
Be this, however, as it may, it seems tolerably certain
that the rebuff he received from Dickens had no hand in turning
him into the path of letters, towards which his genius and unerring
judgment alone most fortunately guided him.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII.</h3>

<h5><i>CONTEMPORARIES OF JOHN LEECH: RICHARD DOYLE
AND JOHN TENNIEL.</i></h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">We</span> gather from the article in &ldquo;The Month&rdquo; which followed his
death, and to which we have to acknowledge materials of which
we have availed ourselves in the revision of the present chapter,<a name="FnAnchor_186" href="#Footnote_186"><span class="sp">186</span></a>
that Richard Doyle&rsquo;s first work was <i>The Eglinton Tournament,
or the Days of Chivalry Revived</i>, which was published when he was
only fifteen years old. Three years later he produced <i>A Grand
Historical, Allegorical, and Classical Procession</i>, a humorous pageant
which the same authority tells us combined &ldquo;a curious medley
of men and women who played a prominent part on the world&rsquo;s
stage, bringing out into good-humoured relief the characteristic
peculiarities of each.&rdquo; Apart from his talent, it was no doubt
the fact of his being his father&rsquo;s son&mdash;the son of John Doyle, the
once famous and eminent <span class="cn">HB</span>&mdash;which first attracted the attention of
the promoters of <i>Punch</i>, and he was only nineteen when, in 1843,
he was taken on the regular pictorial staff of that periodical. It was
to the cheery, delightful pencil of Richard Doyle that the paper
owed much of the popularity which it subsequently achieved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was from his father that he not only inherited his artistic
talent, but received, and that almost exclusively, his artistic training.&rdquo;
The writer in &ldquo;The Month&rdquo; goes on to tell us that John Doyle would
not allow his son &ldquo;to draw from models; his plan was to teach the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page382" id="page382"></a>382</span>
boy to observe with watchful eye the leading features of the object
before him, and then some little time after reproduce them from
memory as nearly as he could.... He had no regular training
in academy or school of art; he painted in the studio of no master
save his father; and it is curious to see how his genius overleapt
what would have been serious disadvantages to an ordinary man....
He attached himself to no school; he was not familiar,
strange to say, with the masterpieces of foreign artists. He had
never been in Paris, or Rome, or Vienna.&rdquo; It will be well for the
reader to bear this in mind, because Doyle is one of the few book
illustrators or etchers whom the professional art critic has condescended
to notice, and it will enable him the better to understand
and appreciate the soundness of his criticism. No one, we are told,
owed less than Richard Doyle &ldquo;did to those who had gone before
him; and if this rendered his works less elaborate and conventional,
it gave them a freshness and originality which might have been
hampered if he had been forced into conformity with the accepted
canons of the professional studio.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_187" href="#Footnote_187"><span class="sp">187</span></a> The writer of the article from
which we have quoted would seem to have read what Mr. Hodder
has told us respecting his friend Kenny Meadows, for the following
is certainly not new to us: &ldquo;He was not a self-taught artist, for he
was trained by one who had a genius kin to his own, but he was an
artist who had never forced himself into the observance of those
mechanical rules and canons which to ordinary men are necessary
to their correct painting (just as rules of grammar are necessary to
correct writing), but hamper and trammel the man of genius, who
has in himself the fount whence such rules proceed, and instinctively
follows them in the spirit, though not in the letter. So far as they
will forward the end he has in view, and no farther.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_188" href="#Footnote_188"><span class="sp">188</span></a> It will be
seen by the above that the kindly writer gives Doyle credit for <i>genius</i>,
and we who are strictly impartial will cheerfully admit that if he had
not positive genius,&mdash;which we somewhat doubt,&mdash;he was certainly
one of the most genial and graceful of comic designers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page383" id="page383"></a>383</span></p>

<p>It was <i>Punch&rsquo;s</i> practice during the earlier years of his career to
produce a new cover with each succeeding volume.<a name="FnAnchor_189" href="#Footnote_189"><span class="sp">189</span></a> Richard
Doyle, however, signalized his accession by the contribution of a
wrapper which was considered too good to be thrown aside at the
expiration of a few months. The well known and admirable design
was stereotyped, and still forms, with certain modifications, the permanent
cover of <i>Punch&rsquo;s</i> weekly series.</p>

<p>Specially worthy of note amongst his <i>Punch</i> designs may be
mentioned <i>The Napoleon of Peace</i> (Louis Philippe), and <i>The Land of
Liberty</i>, &ldquo;recommended to the consideration of Brother Jonathan.&rdquo;
In the latter, allusion is made to the Mexican war, rifle duelling and
rowdyism, repudiation, Lynch law, and the then but no longer
&ldquo;peculiar institution.&rdquo; These will be found in the thirteenth volume,
with a design of great excellence, <i>Punch&rsquo;s Vision at Stratford-on-Avon</i>,
supposed to occur in the house of Shakespeare.</p>

<p>A new English (?) party had been growing up and gradually
forcing itself into English politics. This was the Peace-at-any-price
party, the members of which, oblivious of the fact that the best
preservative of peace is to be found in a perpetual state of readiness
for war, erased from their minds all remembrance of the position
won for the nation by our glorious army and navy, and ruled that
national honour and national obligations must now be considered
subordinate to the interests of peace, trade, and commerce. Conspicuous
among these men of the new school was Mr. Cobden, an
able, earnest, but (so far as our foreign policy was concerned)
thoroughly mistaken enthusiast. He figures as &ldquo;Peace&rdquo; in Doyle&rsquo;s
cartoon of <i>John Bull between Peace and War</i> (<i>i.e.</i> the Duke of
Wellington). In <i>Gentlemen, make your Game while the Ball is
Rolling</i> (1848), the best cartoon ever designed by Richard Doyle,
the various European monarchs are engaged at <i>roulette</i> under
the auspices of <i>Punch</i> himself. The ball is the world, and the
edges of the board are respectively inscribed, &ldquo;Reform,&rdquo; &ldquo;Progress,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Republicanism,&rdquo; &ldquo;Equality,&rdquo; &ldquo;Constitutional Government.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page384" id="page384"></a>384</span>
&ldquo;Anarchy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Liberalism.&rdquo; Bomba of Naples having staked a
large sum, he and other monarchs follow the erratic movements of
the ball with absorbing attention. In the background may be seen the
then Queen of Spain and Louis Philippe, who, having staked their all
and lost, are just leaving the apartment. Another, following up the
same subject, is the political sea serpent of &ldquo;Revolution&rdquo; suddenly appearing
above the surface of the sea and upsetting, one after another,
the cockle-shell boats in which the various European sovereigns are
endeavouring to get to shore. The writer in the Catholic &ldquo;Month&rdquo;
points out the fact that &ldquo;this picture was drawn in the earlier part of
the year, before the Roman revolution, and the Holy Father was still
riding safely unharmed by the monster which is working havoc in
France and Germany, and Austria and Spain.&rdquo; In <i>The Citizen of the
World</i> we find a capital skit upon the &ldquo;admirable Crichton&rdquo; delusion
which made my Lord Brougham fancy himself in every character
he chose to assume, or on any subject to which he condescended to
give his attention, <i>facile princeps</i>. Here we find him figuring in turn
as an English Lord Chancellor, a German student, a French subject,
a French National Guard, an American citizen, a Bedouin Arab,
a Carmelite monk, a Chinese mandarin, an Osmanli, a red Indian,
a Scottish shepherd, and by the unmistakable nose and self-complacent
smirk on his countenance, it is clear that in each and every character
Henry Lord Brougham feels himself thoroughly at home. <i>The
Sleeping Beauty</i> is a clever composition. &ldquo;Beauty,&rdquo; by the way, is
Lord John Russell, and amongst the sleeping attendants may be
recognised the Duke of Wellington, Benjamin Disraeli, Colonel
Sibthorpe, and Lord William Bentinck; while the ever indispensable
Brougham of course puts in an appearance, this time in the character
of a jester.</p>

<p>Richard Doyle, as we have seen, was young when he joined the
ranks of the <i>Punch</i> staff. Young men are apt to &ldquo;dream dreams,&rdquo;
and one of Richard Doyle&rsquo;s was in truth a charming one. In <i>Ireland:
a Dream of the Future</i>, he shows us our Queen gazing into the depths
of an Irish lake, wherein she beholds prosperous towns, smiling fields,
a contented peasantry, flourishing homesteads, a land flowing with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page385" id="page385"></a>385</span>
milk and honey. On the opposite bank sit in dreary solitude a
starving cottier and his family. This was Richard Doyle&rsquo;s dream in
1849. He did not live to wake to the reality of 1884: half a dozen
&ldquo;Gladstone&rdquo; bags filled with American dynamite, the property of
subjects of a republic who allows her mongrel murderers to plot the
deaths of thousands of the people of a friendly nation without lifting
a hand or a finger to restrain them. A home government too
weak to pass a law which would stop these outrages by hanging
these foreign miscreants as high as Haman. These formed no part
of course of the young artist&rsquo;s dream. He delighted in sunshine.
The year 1850 was memorable for the repeal of the window tax,
one of the most extraordinary impositions which ever crossed the
inventive mind of a Chancellor of the Exchequer. &ldquo;Hollo! old
fellow,&rdquo; says a workman to his family, hailing the unwonted appearance
of the sunbeams in their dark and dreary apartment, &ldquo;Hollo!
old fellow; we&rsquo;re <i>glad</i> to see you here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among the numerous illustrations which Doyle designed for <i>Punch</i>,
probably the most original were the series entitled &ldquo;Manners and
Customs of ye Englishe,&rdquo; which, under the title of &ldquo;Bird&rsquo;s-eye Views of
English Society,&rdquo; he afterwards continued in the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i>
in a more elaborate form. The &ldquo;Manners and Customs&rdquo; form a
curious record of the doings of the period, and remind us of &ldquo;Sam
Cowell&rdquo; and the cider cellars, the Jenny Lind mania, Julien and
his famous band, Astleys, the Derby day, and many of the forgotten
scenes and follies in which some of us may have mingled in days gone
by. They are very clever so far as they go; but none of them, as
the writer in &ldquo;The Month&rdquo; would have us believe, are at all &ldquo;worthy
of&rdquo; or in any way remind us of &ldquo;Hogarth&rdquo; (why are all the writers
on <i>comic</i> art immediately reminded of Hogarth?). &ldquo;Each face in one
of these pictures&mdash;<i>A Prospecte of Exeter Hall, showynge a Christian
Gentleman denouncynge ye Pope</i>,&rdquo; says the same writer&mdash;&ldquo;deserves a
careful study, and tells the tale of bigotry, prejudice, and gaping
credulity which has made Exeter Hall a bye-word among men.&rdquo;
Although we agree with the writer on this subject, we would at the
same time take leave to remind him that the Catholics are singularly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page386" id="page386"></a>386</span>
fortunate in England compared with the religious freedom or tolerance
enjoyed by Protestants in Catholic countries&mdash;in Italy for instance,
or in Spain. As for &ldquo;bigotry,&rdquo; let him look only at Catholic France
during the reign of priestcraft there, where an actor of the position
of Talma, writing with reference to a proposed monument to his
English brother, John Kemble, could add by way of shameful
contrast, &ldquo;Je serai trop heureux <i>ici</i> si les pretres <i>me</i> laissent <i>une
tombe dans mon jardin</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When we first completed this chapter, and while the artist was yet
living, we deemed it better to say as little as possible in reference
to the conscientious motives which induced him to throw up his
lucrative position on <i>Punch</i>, and with it the whole of his splendid
prospects in comic art; and this course we had decided to follow
after Richard Doyle had been removed from us by death. As,
however, the Catholic organ has entered fully into the subject, not
only is every cause for further reticence removed, but by being
placed in a position to understand causes and motives, we are
enabled to do justice to the memory of this most generous and
unselfish of men.</p>

<p>The Catholics have cause to feel satisfied with the results of what
the benighted Protestants of England are apt to term the &ldquo;Papal
Aggression.&rdquo; The conduct of the latter in relation to this portentous
event is thus described by &ldquo;The Month&rdquo;:&mdash;&ldquo;In 1850 the
Catholic Hierarchy was established in England, and the Protestant
public raved and stormed and talked bigoted nonsense without end
respecting this new invasion. Parliament passed the futile and
obsolete Ecclesiastical Titles Bill, and <i>Punch</i> took up the popular
cry. Cardinal Wiseman was represented as &lsquo;tree&rsquo;d&rsquo; by the Papal
bull, and comic verses and personal ridicule was lavished on the
Pope, the new hierarchy, and Catholics generally.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doyle remonstrated, but received answer that, as he had been
allowed to turn Exeter Hall and its doings into ridicule, it was only
fair that his own opinions should have their turn. But those who
used this argument little knew, and could scarcely be expected to
know, the difference between the devotion of supernatural faith and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page387" id="page387"></a>387</span>
the bigotry of a self-chosen creed. Doyle was anything but narrow
or over-scrupulous. It was not any of the cartoons which was the
immediate occasion of the step that he took, nor was it (as some
of the notices of him have intimated) any mere personal attachment
to Cardinal Wiseman. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;as long as you keep
to the political and personal side of the matter, but <i>doctrines</i> you
must not attack.&rsquo; Douglas Jerrold and Thackeray were not likely
to appreciate this reversal of the general sentiment, which resents
personal attack above all else. &lsquo;Look at the <i>Times</i>,&rsquo; they
argued; &lsquo;its language has been most violent, but the Catholic
writers on its staff do not for that reason resign. They understand,
and the world at large understands, that the individual contributor
is not responsible for the opinions expressed by other contributors
in articles with which he has nothing to do.&rsquo; &lsquo;That is very well
in the <i>Times</i>,&rsquo; was Doyle&rsquo;s answer, &lsquo;but not in <i>Punch</i>. For the
<i>Times</i> is a monarchy [we believe these were his very words],
whereas <i>Punch</i> is a republic.&rsquo; So, when a week or so later an
article, attributed to Jerrold himself, jeeringly advised the Pope to
&rsquo;feed his flock on the wafers of the Vatican,&rsquo; it was too much for
Doyle. Dignified protest was not sufficient now. To be any longer
identified with a paper which could use such language was intolerable
to the faithful soul. To ply his skilful fingers and busy inventive
brain in behalf of those who scoffed at the Blessed Sacrament of the
Altar was out of the question. His connection with <i>Punch</i> must
cease. But is he bound in conscience to throw away a good income
and congenial work, because there were expressed opinions different
from his own in a paper in which, republic though it was, solidarity
was scarcely possible? Who would expect that in a comic journal
each and all of the contributors should agree with each and every
sentiment expressed? Never mind; whatever Richard Doyle might
have been strictly bound to do, generosity at least urged him to
make the sacrifice&mdash;the sacrifice of his career, of his future success it
may be. At least he could show that Catholic belief was no empty
superstition, no set of mere traditional observances, which sat lightly
on the man of culture, even if in his heart he accepted them at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page388" id="page388"></a>388</span>
all. So he wrote to resign his connection with <i>Punch</i>, stating the
reasons plainly and simply. This was in 1850, after he had been
contributing for more than six years. Now he must simply start
afresh, in consequence of what his Protestant friends regarded as an
ecclesiastical crotchet. He must turn aside from the path of worldly
success; he must give up all for conscience&rsquo; sake. But as the
<i>Daily Telegraph</i> remarks, in an article respecting him that does it
honour, &lsquo;He made a wise and prudent choice. The loss was ours,
not his; and, apart from the claims of his genius to admiration, such
conduct at the critical moment of a career will never cease to command
respect.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Passing by (as we may afford to do) the assertion that we Protestants
&ldquo;raved and stormed and talked bigoted nonsense without
end respecting this new invasion,&rdquo; and the somewhat unnecessary
boast that Lord John Russell&rsquo;s Ecclesiastical Titles Bill has been
suffered to become a &ldquo;futile and obsolete&rdquo; measure, we would recognise
the value of the writer&rsquo;s remarks as establishing in the clearest
possible manner the perfect honesty and unselfishness of the
motives which induced the artist to resign his connection with <i>Punch</i>,
and to throw up the chances of an assured and brilliant future. We
think however, that the value of his statement does not end here.
We may here acknowledge that, while admitting the perfect purity
and disinterestedness of Doyle&rsquo;s motives, we ourselves never
thoroughly understood them until we had read the article from
which we have quoted. We had taken into consideration the fact
that when he took this decided step he was but twenty-five years of
age, and we suspected (let us honestly own it) that other influences
might have been at work independent of the artist himself, of which
we as Protestants must always remain ignorant. There are grounds
on which Protestant and Catholic writers may meet one another even
in connection with religious questions; and although a &ldquo;bigoted&rdquo;
Protestant, I am glad to admit that the writer&rsquo;s clear and lucid
statement has removed an impression that was absolutely without
foundation.</p>

<p>With respect, however, to the ultimate consequences of this decisive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page389" id="page389"></a>389</span>
step, the Catholic writer and ourselves are wholly at variance.
&ldquo;We are inclined to believe,&rdquo; continues the former, &ldquo;that apart
from the respect he earned by his noble sacrifice, Mr. Doyle
achieved a higher reputation in consequence of his retirement from
comic journalism, than if he had continued to employ his pencil in
its services all his life through. It is true that his name was not,
towards the end of his life, so familiar to the popular mind of England
as was that of John Leech at the end of his career, and as that
of Du Maurier at the present time, but the work which he did in
his later life was more lasting and more world-wide. <i>Punch</i> is an
English periodical; you must be an Englishman to understand the
allusions. The humour is essentially and almost exclusively English;
it would never attain any great popularity in other English-speaking
nations, in spite of its undoubted claim to be the first comic journal
in the world. If Doyle had confined himself to the pages of <i>Punch</i>,
or directed his energies mainly to the weekly issue of some design
in its numerous columns, the limnings of his pencil would scarcely
be known outside of England, whereas all over the continent of
America, and in the English colonies, the old Colonel Newcome,
and the Marquis of Farintosh, Lady Kew, and Trotty Veck meet
us with their familiar faces as we turn over the Transatlantic editions
of Thackeray and Dickens, not to mention the exquisite paintings,
of which we shall have more to say presently, exhibited in the
Grosvenor Gallery, and to be found in many a country mansion as
a lasting memorial of Dicky Doyle.&rdquo; Does the writer seriously mean
to tell us that Doyle could not illustrate Thackeray and Dickens at
the same time and side by side with his illustrations for <i>Punch</i> or
any other serial of a satirical character? Granted that <i>Punch</i> is a
periodical appealing to English tastes and sympathies, yet it was
through the introduction obtained by means of its pages that the
artist probably obtained employment upon the very works to which
the writer refers, and upon which (as he claims) his reputation will
rest.</p>

<p>Nor do we, nor can we, admit that, out of the circle of his coreligionists,
or the still narrower circle of educated unbiassed minds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page390" id="page390"></a>390</span>
Doyle reaped much respect by the &ldquo;noble sacrifice&rdquo; of which the
writer speaks. English prejudice looks with special coldness on
conscientious motives it does not understand, and with which it can
have but little sympathy. Doyle was a man of purer motives and
finer sympathies than George Cruikshank; but the same insular prejudice
which conduced to the ruin of George Cruikshank, wrecked
the future prospects of an artist almost as original in some respects as
the more brilliant George. From the moment that Doyle retired
from <i>Punch</i>, English fanaticism and English prejudice persisted
in regarding him as a supporter of the &ldquo;Papal aggression,&rdquo; and
he permanently lost from that moment the ground which his
talent and his reputation had so honourably won for him. From
the moment he deemed it his duty to retire from the circle of
literary and artistic wits and humourists with whom he was then
associated, he took himself practically out of the range of comic art,
and the public ceased to trouble itself about him, although it had
lost (in the expressive language of Mr. Thackeray) &ldquo;the graceful
pencil, the harmless wit, the charming fancy,&rdquo; of one of the most
genial and promising of English graphic satirists of the modern time.
Before he left <i>Punch</i> he had executed for the periodical upwards
of five hundred illustrations, of which nearly eighty are cartoons.</p>

<p>But Richard Doyle manifested the honesty of purpose which was
a part of his noble nature by other sacrifices than his retirement from
<i>Punch</i>. From the friendly hand which has strewn flowers upon
his grave, we learn that at one time he was offered a handsome income
to draw for a periodical started some years ago, but declined
the engagement because he disapproved of the principles of those
by whom it was conducted. &ldquo;At another he had a similar offer
made him by a distinguished statesman on behalf of a political
journal, in which the work would have been light and the remuneration
excellent.&rdquo; He was offered his own terms to illustrate an
edition of Swift&rsquo;s humorous works; but here too he refused, because
he did not admire the morality of the witty Dean of St Patrick&rsquo;s.
&ldquo;In these and other cases like them, religion, virtue, high principle,
carried the day against interests which would have proved too much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page391" id="page391"></a>391</span>
for any but a man of Doyle&rsquo;s noble and lofty character.&rdquo; His biographer
points out the fact that all this while he had to look to his
pencil for bread, and denies the statement, made by one of the leading
newspapers at the time of his death, that during the latter part
of his life he was independent of his profession.</p>

<p>In one set of illustrations, now very scarce and little known,
Doyle has shown that he possessed eminent powers as a caricaturist.
We have a set of lithographs before us, entitled, &ldquo;Rejected Cartoons,&rdquo;
a sort of pictorial &ldquo;Rejected Addresses,&rdquo; supposed to be intended
for the then new Houses of Parliament, some of them caricatures
of the works of living artists&mdash;Maclise, Pugin, etc., whose styles
are closely imitated and most amusingly burlesqued. Some of them
are irresistibly droll, such as King Alfred sending the Danes into a
Profound Slumber with the Sleepy Notes of his Harp; &ldquo;Canute
reproving the Flattery of his Courtiers;&rdquo; The Faces of King John
and his Barons at the Signing of Magna Charta; Perkin Warbeck
in the Stocks; The Meeting of Francis and Harry in the Field of
the Cloth of Gold, etc. Few people with whom the touch of Richard
Doyle is perfectly familiar would recognise his hand in these
amazing and amusing cartoons. We met with them at a bookstall
twenty years ago, unconscious until lately that they were due to
his pencil.</p>

<p>The once celebrated &ldquo;Adventures of Brown, Jones, and Robinson&rdquo;
would alone secure for this artist an eminent position amongst the
number of English comic designers. Graphically relating the experiences
of the most ordinary class of continental tourists, they
cannot fail to bring to the recollection even of the most commonplace
traveller some of the experiences which may have actually
happened to himself. Doyle of course enlarges on these experiences
as his fancy and imagination suggest; but after all, there is little
which might not have actually befallen any ordinary English
travellers such as this unlucky trio. The episode of &ldquo;Jones&rsquo;s Portmanteau
undergoing the ordeal of Search&rdquo; at Cologne; The scene
at the &ldquo;Speise-Saal&rdquo; Hotel; The Jewish &ldquo;Quarter of the City of
Frankfort, and what they saw there&rdquo;; The Gambling Scene at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page392" id="page392"></a>392</span>
Baden: The Descent of the St. Gothard; The Academia at Venice;
will appeal to the actual experiences of nearly every continental
tourist; and notwithstanding its extravagant drollery, little Browne&rsquo;s
adventure at Verona is sufficiently possible to remind one of personal
vicissitudes encountered off the track or on the frontiers, which
might almost match the experiences of this personally uninteresting
little sketcher.</p>

<p>Besides <i>Punch</i>, Mr. Doyle&rsquo;s hand will be found in the following:&mdash;&ldquo;The
Fairy Ring,&rdquo; Leigh Hunt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jar of Honey,&rdquo; Professor
Ruskin&rsquo;s &ldquo;King of the Golden River,&rdquo; Montalba&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fairy Tales
from all Nations,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jack and the Giants,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Cornhill Magazine,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Pictures from the Elf World,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Bon Gaultier Ballads,&rdquo;

PLanche&rsquo;s &ldquo;Old Fairy Tales,&rdquo; À Beckett&rsquo;s &ldquo;Almanack of the Month,&rdquo;
&ldquo;London Society,&rdquo; and Mr. Thackeray&rsquo;s &ldquo;Newcomes.&rdquo; Writing
of this last, Mr. Hamerton says, &ldquo;I never regretted the hard
necessity which forbids an art critic to shut his eyes to artistic
shortcomings more heartily than I do now in speaking of Richard
Doyle. Considered as commentaries on human character, his
etchings are so full of wit and intelligence, so bright with playful
satire and manly relish of life, that I scarcely know how to write
sentences with a touch at once light enough and keen enough to
describe them&rdquo;;<a name="FnAnchor_190" href="#Footnote_190"><span class="sp">190</span></a> and then the critic goes on to expose the glaring
faults which characterize Mr. Doyle&rsquo;s performances from a purely
artistic point of view, his feeble attempts of light, his undeveloped
&ldquo;sense of the nature of material,&rdquo; and his absence of imitative
study. It is somewhat singular that whilst Mr. Hamerton is silent
on the subject of the book etchings of Leech and Phiz, he should
have selected for criticism those of Doyle, who never intended to
claim for these sketches the dignity of <i>etchings</i>. The critic, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page393" id="page393"></a>393</span>
is not only just, but remarkably fair. With reference to the illustrations
to the &ldquo;Newcomes,&rdquo; he acknowledges &ldquo;their all but inestimable
dramatic value.&rdquo; &ldquo;Illustrations to imaginative literature,&rdquo;
he continues, &ldquo;are too frequently an intrusion and an impertinence,
but these really added to our enjoyment of a great literary masterpiece,
and Doyle&rsquo;s conception of the Colonel, of Honeyman, of
Lady Kew, is accepted at once as authentic portraiture. In Ethel
he was less happy, which was a misfortune, as she was the heroine
of the book; but many of the minor characters were successes of
the most striking and indisputable kind.&rdquo; Further on, he says
of Doyle&rsquo;s etching, <i>A Student of the Old Masters</i>,&mdash;&ldquo;Colonel
Newcome is sitting in the National Gallery, trying to see the merits
of the old masters. Observe the enormous exaggeration of aërial
perspective resorted to in order to detach the figure of the Colonel.
The people behind him must be several miles away; the floor of
the room, if judged by aërial perspective only, is as broad as the
Lake of Lucerne.&rdquo; The criticism, though exaggerated, is not
unfair or unjust; but the people are certainly not miles away.
Doyle has perpetuated a mistake common with many English artists,
who seem to think, as Hazlitt expresses it, that, &ldquo;if they only leave
out the subordinate parts, they are sure of the general result.&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_191" href="#Footnote_191"><span class="sp">191</span></a>
Doyle&rsquo;s intention to give us a portrait of Colonel Newcome <i>only</i>
has prompted him to treat the subordinates as almost non-existent.
His work, however, was never intended to be faultless; it carries
out his own intention most thoroughly and admirably, and in a
manner very far superior to anything which Thackeray himself
could have done.</p>

<p>The closing scenes in the life of this most amiable and unselfish
of artists we give in the singularly graceful words of his Catholic
biographer: &ldquo;In the autumn of last year (1883), Mr. Doyle spent
some time in North Devon, and while there painted a picture of
Lynton churchyard. The view is taken at a distance of some ten
or fifteen yards to the south-west of the church, and is looking in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page394" id="page394"></a>394</span>
an easterly direction. In front of the picture one sees far down
below the blue waters of the Bristol Channel, while behind the
picturesque little church nestles among the trees. In the churchyard
an old man is mowing down the long grass amid the graves,
while two or three little children scatter flowers on one of them.
This picture was unfinished at the time of his death. A strange
coincidence that he should have chosen such a scene for his last
picture, when, as far as man can judge, he had no sort of reason for
thinking that death was so near; stranger still, that on his return
home he chose for the sketch a black frame, as if to clothe it in
the garb of mourning for its maker. There it remains on his easel,
unfinished still, as if to tell of one cut off so suddenly, not indeed
in the summer of life, but in a mellow autumn, which seemed to
give promise of many years of good work still to be done. But
the time had come when the little sprites who peopled his dreams
of earth, were to be exchanged for the angel forms who were to
welcome the faithful servant to his reward in heaven. On the 10th
of December, as he was preparing to return from the Athenæum
club, Mr. Doyle was struck down by apoplexy. An ambulance was
procured, and he was carried home. He never regained the power
of speech, and it is doubtful whether he was ever again conscious,
though the priest who anointed him for his journey from thence
to heaven thought that he detected some traces of a joyful acquiescence
in the rite. The next morning, in the home where the
last years had been spent in quiet peaceful pursuit of the art he
passionately loved, his simple, innocent, loyal soul passed away
from earth to heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center1" style="letter-spacing: 3em;">******</p>

<p>It will be admitted that Mr. Tenniel joined the ranks of the
graphic satirists at the commencement of troublous times. The
nations of Europe, with the exception of England, whose slumbers
still remained unbroken, were all more or less awake. Prussia, insufficiently
avenged (as she herself considered) at Waterloo for the
unendurable humiliations which Napoleon had heaped upon her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id="page395"></a>395</span>
after Jena, had been unostentatiously preparing for another deadly
struggle with France, and perfecting the most admirable military
machinery of modern times. Russia, under Nicholas, a thorough
soldier in theory, had an army so elaborately over-drilled that when
the time came it was found practically useless for the purposes of
actual warfare. The sleep of England was suddenly awakened by
the war with Russia, and afterwards by the revolt of her Indian
mercenaries. The Russian was to be followed by a war between
France and Austria; the enfranchisement of Italy from the Alps
to the Adriatic; the fratricidal struggle between Prussia and Austria,
and the rending asunder within six weeks of the famous Germanic
Confederation of the Rhine. It is a somewhat singular coincidence
that immediately before the commencement of these troubles the
great Duke of Wellington died, an event commemorated by two
remarkable cartoons of Tenniel, the first of which is entitled
<i>September</i> <span class="sc">XIV.</span> <i>MDCCCLII.</i> (the day of the great soldier&rsquo;s death),
and the other, <i>The Duke&rsquo;s Bequest&mdash;for the most Worthy</i>.</p>

<p>The year 1853 opened the eyes of those of us who fancied that
war was a thing of the past, and that the reign of Universal Peace
had begun. Not only was Turkey at war with Russia, but had
given her a tremendous thrashing at Oltenitza, an event alluded to
in the artist&rsquo;s cartoon of <i>A Bear with a Sore Head</i>. One of the
best of his satires of the same year depicts Aberdeen as he appeared
in <i>The Unpopular Act of the Courier of St. Petersburg</i>, wherein the
premier attempts the risky feat of driving a team of unmanageable
horses. The features of the nervous athlete betray much anxiety;
the two fiery leaders, Russia and Turkey, prove wholly beyond his
control; while Austria, unsettled by their bad example, is much
disposed to be troublesome.</p>

<p>Matters went from bad to worse in 1854. England was not only
thoroughly aroused but angry, not only with her enemies, but with
the foolish people who had preached peace to her when there was
no peace; and, in <i>What it has Come to</i>, we find my Lord Aberdeen
vainly trying to hold in the British lion, whose ire has been roused
by the Russian bear, who is seen scampering off in the distance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page396" id="page396"></a>396</span>
Away goes the lion, with his tail as stiff as a poker and every hair
of his mane erect, dragging after him the frightened premier, who
exclaims, in the extremity of his terror, that he can hold him no
longer and is bound &ldquo;to let him go.&rdquo; The Russian war showed
our singular unreadiness for warfare. Just at its close we had provided
ourselves with a fleet of vessels of light draught capable of
floating in the shallows which surrounded the Russian fortifications,
which, had they been ready at the time they were wanted, might
have proved of incalculable service. Britannia disconsolately eyes
these gun-boats from the summit of her cliffs. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she sighs,
&ldquo;if you&rsquo;d been only hatched a year ago, what might have come out
of your shells!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Close upon the heels of the Russian war followed the mutiny of
our Indian levies. So closely did one event follow the other, that
those who have watched and learnt with reason to distrust the
odious and insidious policy of Russia towards this country, considered
the coincidence a more than singular one. The Franco-Austrian
war came next; and the war wave passed onwards to
America, where the Northern and Southern states were speedily
engaged in fratricidal and deadly strife. Peace, driven from land
to land, found no resting place for the sole of her foot, and the
artist shows her to us, seated disconsolately pondering over these
untoward matters and her own unhappy condition on the breech of
a garrison gun.</p>

<p><i>Punch&rsquo;s</i> low estimate of the character and abilities of the Emperor
Louis is patent throughout those of Tenniel&rsquo;s satires in which he
puts in an appearance. In 1853 he takes us to an <i>International
Poultry Show</i> (in obvious reference to the Boulogne catastrophe)
where, amid a variety of eagles&mdash;the American eagle, the Prussian
eagle&mdash;the double-headed Austrian and Russian eagles&mdash;we find a
wretched nondescript, half eagle half barn-door fowl, labelled the
&ldquo;French eagle.&rdquo; Victoria (a royal visitor) remarks to her astonished
companion, &ldquo;We have nothing of <i>that</i> sort, Mr. Punch;
but should there be a <i>lion</i> show, we can send a specimen!!&rdquo; The
approaching marriage of the French Emperor is alluded to in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page397" id="page397"></a>397</span>
cartoon of <i>The Eagle in Love</i>, in which the present ex-Empress
(then Comtesse de Teba), whose likeness by the way is far from
happy, is represented as cutting his talons. The air of mystery
which was a part of his character, and was not so well understood
in those days as it afterwards came to be, not unnaturally misled
Mr. Tenniel, for in his satire, <i>Playing with Edged Tools</i>, we behold
him studying (of all things in the world) a model of the guillotine,
an instrument of terror to which those of the Bonaparte family who
profess to be guided by the policy of the great Napoleon, must
always entertain the greatest possible aversion.</p>

<p><i>Punch</i> not only looked upon the third Napoleon as a treacherous
man, but also as a dangerous and inconvenient neighbour. In the
cartoon labelled, <i>An Unpleasant Neighbour</i> (1859), we see him in
the act of placing outside his firework shop a flaming advertisement,
whereon we read in the largest possible type, &ldquo;Blaze of Triumph!
Roman Candles!&mdash;Italian Fire!&rdquo;<a name="FnAnchor_192" href="#Footnote_192"><span class="sp">192</span></a> His neighbour, John Bull,
proprietor of &ldquo;The Roast Beef House&rdquo; next door, rushes out in
a very excited state, &ldquo;Here have I got,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;to pay double
insurance, all along of <i>your</i> confounded fireworks!&rdquo; The next
cartoon shows us Louis, <i>alias</i> &ldquo;Monsieur Walker,&rdquo; after he has closed
his establishment and chalked up, &ldquo;The Business to be disposed
of,&rdquo; while incredulous John places his finger to his nose as Louis
assures him, &ldquo;Ah, friend Johnny! I close my shop entirely to please
<i>you</i>!&rdquo; In <i>The Congress Quadrille</i>, Louis vainly essays to make
himself agreeable to Miss Britannia (a good example of the artist&rsquo;s
handsome women)&mdash;&ldquo;Voulez-vous danser, Mad&rsquo;moiselle?&rdquo; says
Louis. Britannia, however, having been his partner on more than
one memorable occasion, had had quite enough of him and his
peculiar style of dancing. &ldquo;Thanks,&mdash;no!&rdquo; she languidly replies,
thinking doubtless of her experiences of the Russian quadrille&mdash;of
the Chinese country dance, etc., etc. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure of the figure&mdash;and
<i>know nothing of the Finale</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Tenniel&rsquo;s art training before he joined the <i>Punch</i> staff, combined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page398" id="page398"></a>398</span>
with his undoubted genius, renders him unquestionably one of
the most versatile of modern designers. His satire is something
quite apart from his caricature, and the former is characterized by a
strong dramatic element particularly noticeable in serious illustrations,
such as his designs to &ldquo;The Pythagorean,&rdquo; in the second
volume of &ldquo;Once a Week.&rdquo; In caricature he resumes in a measure
the manner of the older caricaturists, without retaining a trace of their
vulgarity, and a good example will be found in his cartoon of <i>What
Nicholas heard in the Shell</i> (1854), in which the features and salient
points of the figure are intensely overdrawn. His caricature pure
and simple seems to us always inferior to his satirical power; as fine
examples of the latter we may mention: <i>The British Lion Smells a
Rat</i> (an angry lion sniffing at a door, in allusion to the conference
which followed the fall of Sebastopol); <i>The British Lion&rsquo;s Vengeance
on the Bengal Tiger</i>, which chronicles the ghastly massacre of
Cawnpore; <i>Bright the Peace Maker</i> (1860), in which <i>Punch</i> testifies
his indignation at the manner in which Mr. Bright endeavoured to
create a popular feeling against the House of Lords; <i>Poland&rsquo;s Chain
Shot</i> (1863), a stirring and powerful composition, wherein Poland,
gallantly struggling once more for freedom, breaks her chains and
fiercely rams them into a cannon; <i>Humble Pie at the Foreign Office</i>
(1863), and <i>Teucer Assailed by Hector is Protected by the Shield of
Ajax</i> (1864), in which Lord John Russell is the subject of satire;
and <i>The False Start</i> and <i>Out of the Race</i> (the same year), in the
first of which Palmerston endeavours to restrain the leaning of
Gladstone towards democracy, the last showing the result of his
inattention to the starter&rsquo;s warning. In all these and a host of
other admirable satires, the superior art training of Mr. Tenniel is
seconded by his strong dramatic power, and above all by his unquestionable
<i>genius</i>. It would be a poor compliment to him to
deny that he had his failings&mdash;which indeed of the admirable satirists
who preceded him had not? His failings, when they do occur, are
perhaps more noticeable on account of his style and the mode in
which he frequently drapes his figures. We have heard it objected
to him, for instance, that the beauty of his female figures is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page399" id="page399"></a>399</span>
occasionally marred by the somewhat disproportionate size of their
feet, and this charge seems to us sustainable. Mr. Tenniel displays
rare excellence in the drawing of animals&mdash;an excellence peculiarly
noteworthy in such cartoons as <i>The British Lion Smells a Rat</i>, and
<i>The British Lion&rsquo;s Vengeance on the Bengal Tiger</i>.</p>

<p>Embracing a period of only fourteen years, from 1851 to 1864,
during which time he worked side by side with his friend and
colleague, John Leech, on the pages of <i>Punch</i>, our notice of the
cartoons of John Tenniel must necessarily be short. During the
last three years of his life, when, as we have seen, the strength of
the artist who had been on the pictorial staff from the commencement
had been gradually failing, the execution of the weekly
cartoons had fallen almost entirely upon Mr. Tenniel. As fellow-labourers,
constantly associated on the same periodical, we are
enabled to compare their individual merits. The conclusion we
have arrived at is as follows: That as a political <i>satirist</i>, Tenniel
is the best of the two; while as a delineator of English habits,
manners, eccentricities, and peculiarities, Leech finds no equal.
After 1864, when the artistic friendship and partnership (so to
speak) of these gifted men was dissolved by the untimely death of
John Leech, it would be beyond the declared scope and purpose of
this work to follow Mr. Tenniel further. Unlike the caricaturists
who preceded him, many of whom relied on humour, more or less
forced, for the success of their productions, the cartoons of John
Tenniel are oftentimes distinguished by a gravity and sternness of
purpose which, combined with their artistic excellence, appeals
forcibly to the imagination. Unfortunately, as in the case of those
of John Leech, these truly admirable examples of nineteenth century
satire, apart from the <i>Punch</i> volumes themselves&mdash;owing to the
material on which they are impressed and the process to which
the original drawings are subjected&mdash;are practically valueless by the
side of an indifferent caricature torn from the scurrilous and worthless
pages of &ldquo;The Scourge&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Meteor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To the persons who charge this artist with want of humour, his
cartoon of <i>Britannia Discovering the Source of the Nile</i>&mdash;probably the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page400" id="page400"></a>400</span>
most comical picture in the whole of the <i>Punch</i> volumes&mdash;will afford
the most conclusive answer, as will also the quaint and mirth-provoking
little pictures which he designed for &ldquo;Alice in Wonderland,&rdquo;
its sequel, &ldquo;Through the Looking-glass,&rdquo; and the 1864 edition
of the &ldquo;Ingoldsby Legends.&rdquo; One of these last, by the way, so
closely resembles a scarce design of John Leech&rsquo;s in the &ldquo;New
Monthly,&rdquo; that the coincidence will strike any one who has an
opportunity of comparing the two together. During the fourteen
years that Mr. Tenniel was a fellow-worker with the late John
Leech, he contributed to the pages of <i>Punch</i> about 1,400 designs, of
which upwards of 400 are cartoons. We believe we are correct in
stating that all these illustrations, and his subsequent and contemporary
designs, were drawn at once upon the wood block, not a
single preliminary sketch having been made.</p>

<p class="center1" style="letter-spacing: 3em;">******</p>

<p>Here, in accordance with the plan which we designed when we
sat down to write this work, we bring our labours to a close. If we
have omitted all mention of two very excellent and talented artists,
Messrs. Charles Keene and George Du Maurier, it is not from any
lack of appreciation, but because one of them at least began his
labours just about the period when those of John Leech were
drawing to a close, while the reputation of both were made <i>after</i>
their distinguished contemporary was laid to his rest. The merits of
both these able men and of those now following after them must
be left to be dealt with by another chronicler. Although, as we
remarked in our opening chapter, the wood engraver has rung the
knell of English caricature, with such clever men as Colonel
Seccombe, Mr. Proctor, Mr. Randolph Caldicott, Mr. F. Barnard,
the present George Cruikshank, Mr. Chasemore, and others whose
names do not at present occur to us, there is happily no prospect of
a decline in the art of English graphic satire.</p>
